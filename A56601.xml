            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I was not ſwayed more by the love of Truth, than of my own Credit, I ſhould, for many reaſons, have ſuppreſſed this following Letter. Which diſcovers ſo many groſs falſhoods in the
<hi>reflections</hi> which have been made on the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> that, whatſoever Cenſures may be paſſed on <hi>me,</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may receive ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from <hi>it.</hi> Which that I <pb facs="tcp:52831:3"/> might not hinder by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too big a Book into his hands, I have caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a great deal of what I had writ about other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths and abſurd reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: hoping that this will be ſufficient to make thoſe that peruſe it wary and obſervant; and then they may detect the reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without my aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And truly the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulty I met withal in this work, was to reſolve what things I ſhould ſingle out as Inſtances of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, falſifyings, <pb facs="tcp:52831:3"/> and miſunderſtandings, &amp;c. of my New Adverſary. Which proved, I confeſs, a buſineſs ſo tedious, in ſuch a great number as lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; that to eaſe my ſelf of too great a labour, I was conſtrained at laſt to take them juſt as they came next to my thoughts. If it chance by this means that I have left any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, which ſome deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt of all ſhould have been handled, there is no remedy: And it is better that they ſhould want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſatisfaction, than that <pb facs="tcp:52831:4"/> all ſhould be tired with the length of my Diſcourſe. Beſides, I find that I my ſelf have ſuffered by it; for I have paſſed by ſundry reflections wherein my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon was more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned; which came not to mind till my Letter, I thought, was ſwell'd to too large a Bulk. This is ſome ſign that I am not ſo melancholy as my Adverſary muſes (for ſuch men uſe to be more reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than to forget the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that are done them) and that I have no liſt to <pb facs="tcp:52831:4"/> write a Book merely to clear my ſelf from falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. And indeed I found other matter to make this Treatiſe larger than I intended: which was a <hi>Caſe</hi> that came to my hand after I had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Apology.</hi> Whatſoever belonged to me in thoſe Sheets, I have alſo ſpent a few thoughts upon: But took not my ſelf to be concerned in his bold challenge to anſwer a Book, which I have not the leaſt knowledge of, and which another perſon, he <pb facs="tcp:52831:5"/> tells me, is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bound (I am ſure is better able) to reply unto, if he think it worthy his pains. I cannot tell nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether that perſon be ingaged in honour to accept the challenge; no, though he proclaim him a Coward, if he do not: For to anſwer ſome men (as one well ſpeaks) is but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their Gibberiſh for thoſe that underſtand it not, and thereby to bring their folly into more credit and requeſt. I apply not this to that Book, which, <pb facs="tcp:52831:5"/> as I ſaid, I am perfectly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of; and may deſerve conſideration: But to ſuch vainglorious Challenges as I have ſeen from mere Barbarians and Savages, who imagine roaring and being furious is far more noble than ſpeaking and reaſoning. Mr. <hi>Vavaſor Powel</hi> I remember made a challenge<note n="*" place="margin">June 11. 1652.</note> to any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Scholar of ours to diſpute Publickly, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately on this Queſtion (and another) <hi>Whether our mixed way, or their way of Separation was <pb facs="tcp:52831:6"/> neareſt to the Word of God?</hi> But it was drawn up in ſuch rude and Kitchin <hi>Latine</hi> as never, I think, ſaw the light ſince the <hi>Goths</hi> ſack'd <hi>Rome;</hi> and as evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that he thought his ſufficiency to be greater than it was, and that men take themſelves ſometimes to be true owners of things, of which they are but mere <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Policy</hi> (which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo carps at) a work of equal ſtrength and beauty; <pb facs="tcp:52831:6"/> it hath an Author who needs no aſsiſtant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it againſt the ableſt Champion they can bring into the Field. Time will ſhew the truth of this; and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of it, leſt thoſe commendations which that Author hath in kindneſs beſtowed on my poor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſhould look in the eyes of our Enemies, like bartering with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the return of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>I have but one thing more to add, which was <pb facs="tcp:52831:7"/> omitted in its proper place, but fit to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, Page <hi>118.</hi> of the following Book. There you will find Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> affirms, <hi>That both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes abjured Epiſcopacy</hi> (whatſoever ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the contrary) <hi>by the Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, I muſt add, by their Declaration of the Fifth of <hi>Auguſt, 1645.</hi> ſent to the <hi>Lords States</hi> General of the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> who by their Embaſſadours had, among <pb facs="tcp:52831:7"/> other things, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and offered from the King the calling of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod</hi> to
<hi>correct</hi> and <hi>redreſs</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Biſhops. One of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers there given, why they could not admit of that Mediation, was, <hi>That not only the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and the Members of both Houſes of Parliament, but alſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of others of his Majeſties Subjects of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:52831:8"/> bound by their late Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the extirpation of the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Biſhops in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and to hinder the ſetting of it up again in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Scotland. This paſſage I find the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> of
<hi>Scotland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Houſes of, both in their Papers of the
<hi>20.</hi> and <hi>24.</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1646.</hi> about the diſpoſing of the Kings Perſon; and in their Anſwer upon the new
<pb facs="tcp:52831:8"/> Propoſitions of Peace, and the Four Bills, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>17. December, 1647.</hi> which I thought good here to mention, as a further confutation of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt; whoſe pretenſes I now leave you to conſider.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> He makes no bones for inſtance, as modeſt and humble as he ſeems, to talk of ſeveral things which he doth not underſtand, nor hath examined at all. The very Second Page of his Book gives you a proof of it; where he tells you, <hi>He humbly conceives that every tranſgreſſion of an humane Law, though but Penal, is not ſo culpable or criminous, as is pretended.</hi> Truly, I conceive ſo too, that all Offences are <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52831:13"/> not of equal guilt; but I muſt let him know, that as I did not pretend <hi>every tranſgreſſion</hi> of a Law to be ſo culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the tranſgreſſion of that I ſpoke of, ſo, I humbly conceive, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to skill in the nature of <hi>Laws but Penal,</hi> which he is utterly ignorant of. For both that Law which I mentioned, and all thoſe that he inſtances in, are more than Penal, as is manifeſt to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hath made the leaſt ſearch into theſe matters. A Law that is <hi>but Penal,</hi> as every ordinary Caſuiſt might have taught him<note n="*" place="margin">Inſtead of all, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Dr. <hi>Sanderſon de oblig. conſcientiae Prael.</hi> 82.</note>, <hi>commands nothing;</hi> but only exacts a Penalty in caſe a man think fit to do, or not to do ſome things therein expreſſed: As if a man be choſen Alderman of the City of
<hi>London,</hi> and refuſe to hold the Place, he is by a Law among them to pay a Fine to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>em. Which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Law but Penal, becauſe it doth not require or bind a man to ſerve this Office (he is at liberty whether he will or no) it requires only the payment of ſuch a Sum of Money if he think good not to ſerve. So that here indeed <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52831:14"/> to pay the Money doth ordinarily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Law; becauſe a Law-maker binds us only by declaring his will to Oblige us, and he declares nothing as his will to oblige a man in this caſe, but the payment of a Fine. Which is called a <hi>Penalty</hi> in a large ſenſe, as it is ſomething which a man would not willingly undergo if it were left to his own choiſe, and is impoſed on him in ſtead of another burden which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Government. But what is this to the Law which I had occaſion to mention? Which is not of this ſort, but a <hi>Law Mandatory,</hi> as I may call it; requiring them not to inhabite in ſuch and ſuch places. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account it is a <hi>Moral Law,</hi> to regulate mens manners; and for that cauſe, it is a vertue to obey it, and a vice to diſobey it. Nor doth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Penalty to it alter its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For ſuch Laws are a Rule of life given with an intention to oblige men to obedience; there being few that know of themſelves what is beſt and moſt profitable for common life: And <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52831:14"/> the Penalty is not to be undergone in ſtead of the obedience, but is added to contain Subjects in their duty by the fear of it, becauſe even they who may know what is beſt will not otherwiſe do it. So that in concluſion, ſuch a Law with a Penalty layes a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obligation upon us both <hi>ad poenam</hi> and <hi>ad culpam</hi> as they ſpeak, to ſuffer the puniſhment, and to be ſinners if we diſobey it. There is no doubt of the former, and it is as unreaſonable to queſtion the latter; becauſe the Law contains a Command, and Sin is nothing but the tranſgreſſion of a Command: which tranſgreſſion is greater or leſs according as the will of the Law-maker is more or leſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us; and that is to be known very much by the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of the Penalty whereby it is enacted to move us to obedience. This he might have learnt of Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> whom he quotes directly againſt his meaning. For that Queſtion which this man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves Affirmatively <hi>[Is it not enough to ſatisfie the Law to pay the Mulct or <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52831:15"/> Penalty in ſuch Caſes?</hi> p. 3.] he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers Negatively: And that within a few lines of that very place which this Apologiſt alledges to a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſe. You may find it in his <hi>Holy Living,</hi> Chap. 3. Sect. 1. Rule 7. which begins thus, <hi>Do not believe thou haſt kept the Law when thou haſt ſuffered the puniſhment,</hi> &amp;c. Read the reſt at your leiſure; and do not believe this man who abuſes the Biſhop, and wreſts his words (as their manner is) from their meaning: The Rule that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being directed to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and expreſſed in terms flatly againſt him. <hi>As long,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop, <hi>as the Law is obligatory, ſo long our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> Rule the 4. quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Apol. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If obedience be due, then I hope it is not ſufficient to ſuffer the Penalty; and then this Writer ſhamefully perverts the ſenſe of that Rule, or elſe doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; which is no more but this, that a fixed Cuſtome abrogates a Law, and makes our obedience no longer due to it. While the Law is in force, we ſin if we do not obey it; but a <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52831:15"/> fixed Cuſtom makes it not to be in force, and then we are free from it. This is the ſenſe of the Biſhop; to which nothing need be added, but that whilſt the Law-giver conſtantly declares his will that it ſhould oblige, no Cuſtom can be pleaded, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe be made for doing contrary to it.</p>
            <p>But you think perhaps that he may find ſome relief in Mr.
<hi>Perkins</hi> whom he alſo alledges. You may try if you pleaſe, but if you conſult the place, you will ſee he had ſome reaſon not to tell you where to find it. For firſt he recites his words imperfectly, and doth not let you know that Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> declares, where the Law-maker intends obedience ſimply the Statutes are neceſſary to be kept. And again, that he doth not excuſe men from all blame who break ſome of the <hi>leſſer local Statutes,</hi> but only ſaith, <hi>Students may in ſome ſort excuſe themſelves from the ſin of Perjury, though not from all fault, in breaking ſome of the leſſer local Statutes.</hi> They are his very words
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52831:16"/> in his Second Book of Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 13. in the latter end. But to paſs by this: That part of his words which he cites, are ſo far from reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his purpoſe, that they are againſt him. For firſt, the Law-maker intends obedience ſimply to the Laws that they break, as is manifeſt to all. For ſecondly, they are not Laws meerly for Decency and Order (which Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſpeaks of) but for the preſervation of the being of Chriſtian Society, which is deſtroyed by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diviſion. And therefore third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Penalty is not as beneficial to the ſtate of the Society as actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>As for that which follows in the end of his Anſwer to this Queſtion (which he repeats again, <hi>p.</hi> 128.) it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent. For we do not charge them with a bare omiſſion of what our Governours command, but with a direct oppoſition to it, and that to the great ſcandal of the People, and contempt of the Royal Authority. All which things conſidered, I think in ſtead <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52831:16"/> of making an Apology for the Non-Conformiſts, he had better have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the counſel of
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> to his Uncle when he found him buſie about his Accounts; which was, that he ſhould ſtudy rather how to give no account at all.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> For he is groſly ignorant in other Learning as well as in this; as appears by his diſcourſe about <hi>Ordination by Presbyters,</hi> which follows a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> gave him no occaſion to mention any thing of this nature, but he had a mind it ſeems to give us a taſte of his skill in this great Queſtion; though it be ſo ſmall that I know not how to excuſe his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in medling with it. He ſuppoſes that the <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> (which he makes the ſame with our <hi>Rural Deans</hi>) may lawfully Ordain. And next, that
<hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans</hi> were but ſuch Presbyters; ſo that he who was Ordained by them had not Epiſcopal Ordination. And then thirdly, He would have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Archbiſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and other <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52831:17"/> Learned men concurring in judgment with him, were of this opinion. Every one of which propoſitions are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly falſe, as I will plainly ſhew you by demonſtrating theſe three things. 1. That thoſe called
<hi>Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi,</hi> Rural or Country Biſhops ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Power of Ordination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not of the Order of Biſhops, but Presbyters ſomething advanced above the reſt. 2. On the other ſide, that <hi>Suffragans</hi> had the power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being not meer Presbyters, but Biſhops, as thoſe in the City were. And laſtly, That the late Primate ſaith nothing contrary to this.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: The <hi>Country Biſhops,</hi> ſaith the Council of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi>

<hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> to the Biſhops, in that part of their Dioceſs which was diſtant <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52831:17"/> from the City. But that they had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part of the Epiſcopal Power committed to them, not the whole, we learn from the Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi> preſently after, <hi>Can.</hi> 13. which decreed that the <hi>Chorepiſcopi, or Country Biſhops ought not to ordain either Ppesbyters or Deacons.</hi>

The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Cuſtom was this, That there ſhould be a ſtrict inquiry made into the lives of thoſe who were to be admitted to miniſter in the Church. The care of this lay upon the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, who were to report it to the
<hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> and they having received a good teſtimony of them, certified it to the Biſhop, and ſo the <hi>Miniſter</hi>

                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> was admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holy Orders: But now you <hi>Country Biſhops</hi> would make me ſtand for a Cypher, and take all this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to your ſelves: nay, you permit the Presbyters and Deacons to put in whom they pleaſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Kindred or Affection inclines them, without regard to their worth. But let me, ſaith he, have a note of the Miniſters of every Village; and if any have been brought in by the Presbyters, let them be caſt out again among the common people. And know that he ſhall be but a <hi>Lay-man</hi> whoever he is that is received into

            </p>
            <p>By this it is apparent that <hi>Presbyters</hi> had not power ſo much as to make the loweſt Officers in the Church; and that the
<hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> though above the reſt of the Presbyters, in Office, yet were not ſo high as Biſhops, but were a middle ſort of men between both.

<hi>Apoſtoli,</hi> who preach in the Country Churches, and adminiſter the Sacraments, but have no certain charge. Yet in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> I muſt tell you it was otherwiſe, as appears by the Statute of 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII.
<hi>chap.</hi> 14. where proviſion is made for <hi>Suffragans which had been accuſtomed to be had within this Realm,</hi> as it tells us both in the beginning and the middle of it. And it is enacted that the Towns of
<hi>Thetford, Ipſwich, Colcheſter, Dover, Guilford, Southam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton,</hi> and twenty places more beſides them, ſhould be taken and accepted for
<hi>Sees</hi> of Biſhops Suffragans to be made in this Realm,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this end every Archbiſhop or Biſhop being diſpoſed to have them for the more ſpeedy adminiſtration of Holy things, had the liberty given them to name and elect two fit perſons, and preſent them to the King: who thereupon had full power by the Act to give to which of thoſe two he pleaſed, the Stile, Title, and Name of Biſhop of ſuch of the
<hi>Sees</hi> aforeſaid as he thought <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52831:21"/> moſt expedient: and he was to be called <hi>Biſhop Suffragan</hi> of the ſame See. After which the King was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him by his Letters Patents under the great Seal to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or of <hi>York,</hi> ſignifying his Name, his Stile, Title, and Dignity of Biſhoprick; requiring him to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the ſaid perſon ſo nominated and preſented, to the ſame Name, Title, Stile, and Dignity of Biſhop. For which purpoſe either the Biſhop that nominated him, or the Suffragan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to provide two Biſhops or Suffragans to conſecrate him with the Archbiſhop, and to bear their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able coſts. This Statute though repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt and ſecond of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>

And it is ſufficiently manifeſt from thence that theſe perſons had Epiſcopal Ordination (being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the Archbiſhop, and two Biſhops more) as much as any other. And therefore ſecondly, had Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power and Authority as much as <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52831:21"/> the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, though being dependent on him, the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan could not uſe or execute any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, Power, or Authority but by his Commiſſion under his Seal; as the Statute likewiſe provides.

               </note> the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate did not make void the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Presbyters, but it was with a <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52831:25"/> ſpecial reſtriction to ſuch places, <hi>where Biſhops could not be had:</hi> Which are the very words alſo of Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> in the caſe of the Scottiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.

And they alſo wholly omitted thoſe words at the ſolemn delivery of the Bible inro the hands of the perſon ordained: <hi>Take thou Authority to preach the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. So that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no expreſs tranſmiſſion of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Power, he was wont to ſay, that ſuch Impoſition of hands (by ſome called the Seal of Ordination) without a Commiſſion annexed, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to be <hi>as the putting of a Seal to a Blank.</hi> And if a Biſhop had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and done no more than they did, he thought the ſame quere might have been of the validity of ſuch Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>As for other Reformed Churches, their caſe is widely different from that of theſe men, as he might have learnt from another Biſhop, whom he cites now and then to no purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Bramhall</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Biſhop of

<hi>Chicheſter,</hi> proteſting in open Synod (which then ſate at
<hi>Dort</hi>) that Chriſt inſtituted no parity, but made twelve Apoſtles the chief, and under them ſeventy Diſciples; that Biſhops ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Twelve, and Presbyters of inferiour rank to the Seventy; and challenging the judgment of any learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men that could ſpeak to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Their anſwer was ſilence, which was approbation enough.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52831:26"/> that could not be hoped for in their State.

<hi>Quaeſtors</hi> refuſing to open, becauſe the Law ſeemed againſt it, He opened it himſelf by a private Key, and made the Law give way to utility and neceſſity. The ſame was done in ſome Reformed Churches. The Apoſtles had commended their Keys to Biſhops; nor were they ever lawfully uſed, ſaith he, by any others than Biſhops before that time. When the Roman <hi>Quaeſtors</hi> (he means Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) denying to open the door, and admit any to the Office of Paſtors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would ingage not to preach the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, Some great men, like <hi>Scipio,</hi> choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lay hold on the Keys, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Ordination from the hands of private perſons, than that the Church ſhould be unfurniſhed and the People periſh. They would not have gone out of the Rode if they could have avoided it, as our Presbyterians did of their own accord. Who ought therefore to acknowledge their error, to return into the regular courſe from whence they voluntarily ſtrayed, and <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52831:28"/> not ſtand upon the juſtification of their proceedings by the example of thoſe who are nothing like them: But with all their heart would have intertained ſuch Biſhops as our pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers thruſt out of poſſeſſion, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received ſuch Ordination as here they rejected. But if they reſolve ſtill to continue to maintain what they have done, I would wiſh them to get an abler Apologiſt than this man: and you, my good Friend, I would adviſe to keep this old Saying in your mind, <hi>Remember not to truſt;</hi> no not thoſe that pretend to <hi>learning,</hi> ſeriouſneſs, humility, and modeſty. For you ſee by what hath been ſaid, that this perſon, who makes a ſhew of theſe qualities, is groſly miſtaken (to ſpeak no harſher word) and too boldly indeavours to lead others into errors. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge indeed that there are both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and modeſt men among them; but they are the confident talkers who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally carry the Bell away, and are cried up for all worth and excellency. Do what I can, I muſt think there is too <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52831:29"/> much truth in the cenſure paſſed upon you by the

But let us paſs by this: And obſerve rather how he ſatisfies in the lame excuſe he makes for their not calling the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles alwaies by the name of <hi>Saints.</hi> In the judgment of our Church, ſaith he, it is not neceſſary, as may hence be concluded,
<hi>That in all the Collects for the days ſet apart to commemorate the holy Apoſtles in, there are but two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are ſtiled Saints.</hi> Theſe are his words<note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 43.</note>; but if you love truth, call to mind the Rule I gave you, and <hi>remember not to truſt.</hi> Even they who call one another frequently by the name of
<hi>Saints</hi> have not ſuch a care, as one would expect, of common honeſty, nor of their own fame nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but will aſſert ſuch manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths as lie open to every eye. Turn to the Prayers for particular days in the Service Book, and you ſhall find that they who told him this (for I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably ſuppoſe he took it upon truſt) made no conſcience of what they ſaid. <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52831:32"/> For thoſe glorious perſons, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories are celebrated in our Church (and I hope always will be) are called no leſs than <hi>nine times</hi> in the very body of the Collects by the names of <hi>Saints</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">St. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, St. John, St. Andrew, St. Paul, St. Mark, St. Philip <hi>and</hi> St. James, St. Peter <hi>and</hi> St. James.</note>. Seven of which were
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the other an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and the firſt

<hi>St. Philip and other Apoſtles.</hi> This may teach you to ſuſpect the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theſe men (which may very well be thought to be exceeding care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) who are no more exact in report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of Fact which lie before their eyes. But as for their ſtories which they ſpread up and down, and indeavour to propagate to poſterity <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52831:32"/> by ſtuffing their Books with them (as this man doth) there is the greateſt cauſe to think that either they have no truth at all in them, or are very much altered from their original. You ought to let them paſs for idle tales, unleſs you have better authority for them than theſe mens Books, who you ſee are ſo bold as to report notorious falſhoods which every body can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute. Their Traditions you ſhould look upon as of no more credit than the Popiſh
<hi>Legends:</hi> It being ſo eaſie for men to forget the very words they heard, and to place others in their room; ſo common to add or leave out what is moſt material; ſo hard and often impoſſible to know all the circumſtances in a buſineſs, which very much alter the caſe; and laſtly, there being ſuch a proneneſs in men to invent down-right falſhoods, and to publiſh them for their own advantage. I have now given you an inſtance of it, and I can give you more. The three Covenanting Miniſters, I find, in their anſwer to the Queries of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52831:33"/> of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> had the boldneſs to declare in Print, and poſitively aver, that his Majeſties Commiſſioner reſted ſatisfied with their Covenant, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their explication of it: by which report they hoped to draw the people to a liking of it. But this was ſuch a calumny that the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> thought it neceſſary to clear himſelf of it by a <hi>Manifeſt</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi>

Which brought them to a confeſſion that indeed they never heard him ſay he was ſatisfied, but had only ſome probable reaſons whereby they were induced to believe that he was. And indeed men eaſily believe what they have a mind unto. They believed, or at leaſt gave it out even <hi>in the Pulpit</hi> (ſaith his Majeſty)<note n="k" place="margin">

A moſt horrible thing, that in the Houſe of God, and in that place of his Houſe, which they called the <hi>Chair of Truth,</hi> men ſhould deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch things as either they did not know to be true, or did know to be falſe.</p>

               <note n="l" place="margin">See p. 141.</note>. Goodly! he knew few or none; therefore there were none here in <hi>England</hi> that held Lay-Elders to be of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52831:34"/> Divine right. This is his reaſoning (for he ſatisfies a queſtion by theſe words) and a rare one it is, built alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon his own Ignorance. For we know not a <hi>few</hi> but <hi>many</hi> who were of this opinion. And if he had not been negligent where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and buſie where he needed not have medled, he might have more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known the mind of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Presbyterians.

By which you may ſee that I ſaid they are <hi>Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> with more reaſon, than this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt</hi> had to excuſe them from it: For I wrote from what I knew, and He from what he knew not. But there is another thing which he apologizes for after the ſame manner, in the very language of his predeceſſor <hi>Philaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> whom he was aſhamed to own. <hi>The horrid Murder of his late Majeſty,</hi> ſaith this Writer, <hi>was never underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (that I know of) to be juſtified by any Miniſter in Print, but by</hi> J.

It is very likely that he is ignorant of this, as well as of other matters: but he muſt excuſe us if we know more of theſe men, and <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52831:35"/> ſuch as were none of <hi>J. G.</hi>'s Diſciples. There was one
<hi>L.S.</hi> for inſtance, whom I have read, who maintains that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Fact, in a Book called <hi>Natures Dowry,</hi> or <hi>The Peoples Native Liberty Aſſerted.</hi> It was not Printed till the Year 1652. but written (as he tells us in the Epiſtle) three year before (juſt upon the Kings Murder) on occaſion of a Queſtion propounded to him by a Member of Parliament and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of State. In the firſt Chapter he determines;
<hi>Should any one</hi> (it is eaſie to know whom he means) <hi>by a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and mercileſs obſtinacy be ſhut up and barricado'd againſt the Law, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and Prayers; I ſee not but a people may warrantably go about to break ſuch a one, ſeeing he will not be bended by reaſon.</hi> But look farther and you will find this to be the Title of the <hi>tenth Chapter, That Kings agreeable to the Law of God, may in ſome caſes be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly reſiſted by their Subjects, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe depoſed.</hi> In ſome caſes indeed, he reſolves,
<q>it may be the prudence of the people to pardon their Prince,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52831:35"/> not obſerving his ſtipulation, but their promiſe is out of date, and cannot bind them to further ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Nay, he ſaith, A people whoſe Anceſtors have for themſelves and their poſterity either
<hi>gratis,</hi> or upon inconvenient Articles promiſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obeyſance to any one and his Heirs, may lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ingagement and caſt off the Yoke.</q> And at the end of that Chapter cites the Vote of Parliament at the beginning of the Wars to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Doctrine, <hi>That if the King raiſed Forces againſt the Parliament, he forfeited his Truſt.</hi> But proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the next Chapter, and you will find he comes home to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and determines, <hi>That Kings may render themſelves obnoxious to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of death, according to the Law of God, in ſome caſes to be inflicted by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, in others by private men.</hi> This is the Title of the Chapter. And immediately he betakes himſelf to that very Scripture upon which Mr. <hi>J. Goodwin</hi> grounded his whole diſcourſe: <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52831:36"/> For the Chapter begins thus.
<q>That Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9, 6. <hi>Who ſo ſheds man's Blood, by man ſhall his Blood be ſhed:</hi> reaches all the Sons of <hi>Noah, Princes themſelves,</hi> though they be taller than their Brethren by the head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</q> And he explains it thus; <hi>Whether he ſhed it by himſelf, or by the Miniſtry of ſome other; whether a ſtranger or a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whether alone, or with the help of others, he is a Son of Death: no mortal is excuſed by his greatneſs.</hi> And adds, moſt ridiculouſly,
<q>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> is very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in this point; and concludes that Princes in ſome other caſes are liable to capital puniſhment to be inflicted by private men.</q> As if a Prince attempt to murder another, that perſon invaded may lawfully kill him in his own defence, <hi>nay, is bound by the ſixth Commandement to do it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuffer himſelf to be murdered.</hi> The reſt of the Book is an anſwer (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtrange faſhion) to thoſe places of Scripture which are brought (as he ſpeaks) for the impunity of Tyrants. I will mention but one of his deſperate
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52831:36"/> devices, which you may find in the 18 Chapter to excuſe
<hi>Davids</hi> ſparing of <hi>Saul. It is not impoſſible</hi> (you ſee the ſtile wherein they deceived the people and put off their Ware) <hi>that Davids intereſt might inſenſibly biaſs him into a tender care of the King.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this he determines,
<q>That either <hi>David</hi> ſinned in ſparing of
<hi>Saul,</hi> or elſe his clemency was warranted by ſome precept, or permiſſion, which is not extant in Scripture; and which in all probability was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly given to <hi>David.</hi>
               </q> Here is enough to ſhew what
<hi>Divines</hi> have come out of their School, and how readily they can ſuppoſe a Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for any thing they have a mind to, though there be not the leaſt foot-ſtep of it in Holy Writ. If he be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but hath a liſt to ſtir further in this buſineſs (which he had better ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have touched) I will furniſh him with more, whom I am unwilling to mention. Let me only add that they were the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles, out of which the <hi>Independent</hi> Army drew <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52831:37"/> their worſt Concluſions. The diſcourſe of this man now named is bottom'd upon this Maxime, that <hi>the People are the Original of Power.</hi> A doctrine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in another <hi>Catechiſm</hi>

<hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had the better end of the ſtaff (as that he ſhould not diſpoſe of the Militia, of the Officers of the Crown, of his Children, have no Negative Vote, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will conclude <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52831:37"/> that he was only left to his choice, whether he would be deſtroyed by his Enemies, or by his own proper Act. For if he condeſcended not to theſe demands, being then in their hands that made them, the leaſt he could expect was to be depoſed, and if he granted them, he depoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nay, he that conſiders how all along they ſuppoſed they were his Superiours, to whom he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, will clearly diſcern, that it was upon the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that the <hi>Independents</hi> built their concluſions. And if it were lawful for them to wreſt out of his hands, the Sword of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and to uſe it againſt him, it was no leſs law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, thought the other, to imploy the Sword of <hi>Juſtice</hi> againſt him. At leaſt after they had taken from him his Sword, his Revenues, his Servants, his Children, the liberty of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and, which is more, of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they left the Independents but one ſtep further to go, which was to take away his life: and all <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52831:38"/> that in which they ſurpaſs'd the others was, that they gave the laſt blow to him.</q> All which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, not to load any man with reproaches, but to make them all humble in conſideration of their paſt miſcarriages (to ſay no worſe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I truly hope many of them repent. <hi>The latter day is the ſcholar of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> and no man is too old to learn; eſpecially the amendment of his faults. Which the more ingenuouſly he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, and the leſs he defends, the more likely he is to become a new man. I ſhould have been glad to have ſeen ſomething of this in this Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt, which would better have becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him than to talk of <hi>Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere</hi>'s in my Book, and to hunt about for excuſes of all things, nay, to waſte his time in impertinent reflections on others, in ſtead of acknowledging or taking off the blame from themſelves. <hi>J. G.</hi> he tells you, who juſtified the Kings Murder, was the <hi>Great Goliah and Champion of the Arminians.</hi> What of all that, I pray you? what affinity <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52831:38"/> hath <hi>Arminius</hi> his Doctrine with King-killing, or what Antidote is there in Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> againſt it? I never heard the former taxed with any thing of this nature, though there is a dangerous paſſage in the laſt Chapter of Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> inſtitutions<note n="p" place="margin">Num. 31</note>; which many have obſerved, if the three orders of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have ſuch a power of Kings as he thinks, it is poſſible, they may have. And yet I believe a man may be a
<hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt</hi> (as they ſpeak) and be a good ſubject, and of the contrary perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be a bad: thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ having nothing to do with this matter. But he was reſolv'd to have a fling at the <hi>Arminians</hi> (whom he thinks to hit, I cannot tell: me he doth not hurt, who belong to neither of thoſe parties) nay, he touches this difference I know not how oft, in his Apology; though I gave him no occaſion for it: loving, lapwing-like, to make the moſt pewing and crying when he is fartheſt from his neſt. He ſhould rather have minded what I cited out of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom I perceive he favours more than <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52831:39"/> the other, concerning the points in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between us. I told you his thoughts of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and I could add a great deal more (out of other places of his works) of the great dread he was in of this ſin; of the diſlike he expreſſed that Biſh. <hi>Hooper</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much about
<hi>a Cap and a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice;</hi> and of his opinion about <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Traditions;</hi> but that I ſhould then digreſs too far out of the way, and prevent my ſelf in that which remains of this Apology.</p>

You will find it in his <hi>Preface,</hi> p, 11. where he ſaith, <hi>I cannot but own my utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Principles and Practices of ſome high Conformiſts, or Hectors for Conformity; namely, ſuch as prefer the Romiſh Church before the Reformed tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Churches;</hi> Arminius <hi>before <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52831:39"/> St.</hi> Auſtin;
<hi>who judge</hi> Aerius <hi>a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heretick than</hi> Arius; <hi>who have more charity for thoſe that deny the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Saviour, than for thoſe that ſcruple the ſtrict</hi> Jus Divinum. <hi>of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; and who can with more patience bear a diſpute againſt the very being of a Deity, than about the taking away of a Ceremony,</hi> &amp;c. This is the language not of the bold blades, but of a <hi>modeſt Presbyterian,</hi> of one that uſes
<hi>hard reaſons and ſoft words,</hi> if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf in the very leaf before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going<note n="q" place="margin">Preface <hi>p</hi> 9.</note>. Whatſoever charity they have for us, their good words ſhall never be wanting to themſelves. They will call themſelves <hi>humble</hi> and
<hi>modeſt,</hi> whatſoever they ſay or do: Though they bluſh not to defend themſelves by injuring any body, nor fear to caſt reproaches on whomſoever, that for defence of the truth ſtand in their way. For every part of this Charge is a vile ſlander, and ſome of it is confuted, you ſhall ſee, by himſelf. Which that I may demonſtrate, let me tell you,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, that it is no <hi>Hecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52831:40"/> to aſſert the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. This is no upſtart opinion, broached by ſome ſwaggering hot-brain'd men, who love to rant and vapour beyond other Folk (which is the proper quality of a <hi>Hector</hi>) but hath been antiently belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Church, from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the ſobereſt men in it. I know they would have you to think otherwiſe, and have endeavoured to perſwade the World that it is a novel Doctrine advanced of later times by ſome proud and haughty Divines. Mr.
<hi>Robert Baily</hi> made bold to ſay that before Biſhop
<hi>Bancrofts</hi> time, <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did unanimouſly deny Epiſcopacy to be of Divine Right</hi>

But both the one and the other of theſe, <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52831:40"/> talk'd at random, out of their own imaginations, not from Hiſtorical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
<hi>Archbiſhop Whitgift,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> as the Anſwer to that Letter ſuggeſts, were both of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary perſwaſion. And I can name a Divine of their Opinion elder than either, and much reverenced even by the Presbyterians, who was offered a Biſhoprick alſo, but refuſed it: And that is Old <hi>Bernard Gilpin,</hi> who left the World that very year in which Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> was advanced to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
1583. For when Mr. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> book was newly come forth, a certain
<hi>Cambridge</hi> man, who ſeemed a very great Scholar, came to this famous Preacher, and dealt very earneſtly with him about the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Reformation of the Church. But Mr. <hi>Gilpins</hi> anſwer was, <hi>That he could not allow that any Humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould take place in the Church in ſtead of a Divine Inſtitution.</hi> How, ſaid the man, do you think that this Form of Diſcipline is an Humane Invention? I am, ſaid Mr.
<hi>Gilpin,</hi> altogether of <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52831:41"/> that mind; And as many as diligently turn over the Writings of the Fathers will be of my opinion. O but the later men, replied the <hi>Diſciplinarian,</hi> ſee many things which thoſe antient Fathers ſaw not; and the preſent Church ſeems better provided of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ingenious and induſtrious men. At which Mr.
<hi>Gilpin,</hi> ſaith my Author<note n="ſ" place="margin">Life of
<hi>Bernard Gilpin,</hi> Edit. 4. 1636. <hi>p.</hi> 106, 107,

               </note> ſeemed ſomewhat moved, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>I, for my part, do not hold the virtues of the later men to be compared to the Infirmities of the Fathers.</hi> Which words he uſed on purpoſe, becauſe he perceived this young man had a ſtrong conceit of I know not what rare vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in himſelf; which opinion the good old man was deſirous to root out of him.</p>
            <p>But there is an Authority ancienter than all theſe, viz. <hi>The Form and Order of making and conſecrating Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. confirmed by Act of Parliament. In which <hi>three</hi> things are conſiderable; The very firſt words of the <hi>Preface</hi> are, <hi>That, it is evident to all men reading the holy Scriptures and antient Authors, that <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52831:41"/> from the Apoſtles time, there have been theſe Orders in Chriſts Church, Biſhops, Prieſts; and Deacons.</hi> Then ſecondly, the Prayer after the
<hi>Letany</hi> at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of a Biſhop, begins in this manner:
<hi>Almighty God, giver of all good things, which by thy holy Spirit haſt appointed divers Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in thy Church,</hi> &amp;c. (which muſt needs be underſtood of thoſe before named) And, laſtly, the firſt queſtion to the perſon to be Conſecrated is, <hi>Are you perſwaded that you be called to this Miniſtration according to the will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> To which the Anſwer is, <hi>I am ſo perſwaded.</hi> Put now all theſe together and you will not be able to conceive (as the <hi>Anſwer to the Letter</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">page
12, 13.</note> obſerves) how theſe words ſhould fall from any men not poſſeſſed with this Tenet, that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. For if God by his holy Spirit hath appointed divers Orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Church; and we may find evidently by Scripture and antient Writers that there are three Orders,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52831:42"/> whereof Biſhops the higheſt; and this is made the ground of praying for the Biſhop to be Conſecrated; and he muſt profeſs he is perſwaded that he is called to that Miniſtration according to Chriſts will, then Epiſcopacy (in the opinion of thoſe who compoſed and confirmed this Book) is in ſuch a manner according to Chriſts Will, that it is grounded in Scripture, and appointed by the Spirit of God; and all this hath not been ſaid only of late, nor countenanced only by ſome few, and thoſe of the more Lordly Clergy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For which cauſe, no man ought to be diſgraced with any odious name, much leſs be called an <hi>Hector,</hi> who is now of the ſame Perſwaſion. The moſt illuſtrious perſons that have been in our Church, men far from that boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous humour, have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for this Doctrine, and doubted not but they could maintain it. I need inſtance in no more than two: Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> whoſe mind is well known from his three Letters to <hi>Peter du <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52831:42"/> Moulin,</hi> 1618.<note n="u" place="margin">Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Printed, 1647.</note> to which I refer you: and the late Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> whom the beſt of you have ſpoken of with honour and reverence. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his opinion to be that Epiſcopal Government is not to be derived mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Practice or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that it is originally founded in the Perſon and Office of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> our bleſſed Lord Chriſt<note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> to Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Regal Power.</note>, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent by his Father, afterward ſent his Apoſtles to execute the ſame <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, Epiſcopal, Paſtoral</hi> Office, for the Ordering and Governing of his Church till his coming again: and ſo the ſame Office to continue in <hi>them</hi> and their
<hi>Succeſſors</hi> to the end of the World. But ſuppoſe all our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had been ſilent, or that they are of no eſteem with our Adverſaries, yet ſince this Opinion of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Epiſcopacy hath been aſſerted by other Divines whom they reſpect, it ought not to have been reproached. <hi>Bucer</hi> declares in his Book of the
<hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt</hi> (as I find him cited above 60 years ago<note n="y" place="margin">Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Mr. <hi>Tho. Bell,</hi> chap.
9.</note> juſt as our Book of <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52831:43"/> Conſecration doth, that
<hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt</hi> that <hi>one,</hi> to whom the name of Biſhop was peculiarly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted) ſhould take the care of the Churches, and preſide over all the Presbyters. And nearer ſtill to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of our Book, in his Treatiſe of the <hi>power and uſe of the Miniſtry,</hi> as he is alledged by <hi>Saravia.</hi> Theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Miniſters have been perpetual in the Church, and were preſently in the beginning appointed by the Holy Ghoſt, of <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</hi> He that will ſee more to this purpoſe may read Biſhop
<hi>Mortons</hi> Epiſcopacy Aſſerted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Nay, this is the Language of Antiquity; and they may as well call St.
<hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zum</hi> a <hi>Hector</hi> as any of us: For he ſticks not to tell his Auditors in plain words, that he held his Office by the Law of Chriſt. You may find the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in his ſeventeenth Oration<note n="z" place="margin">page 271.</note> where, after he had exhorted all the People to obedience, he turns his ſpeech more particularly to the Rulers and Magiſtrates, asking them if they <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52831:43"/> will give him leave to ſpeak freely: As truly, ſaith he, I think I may, ſince
<hi>the Law of Chriſt</hi> hath made you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to my Power, and to my Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This you may think is very high: but I muſt let you know they who ſeem to lay their claim lower, and ſpeak in a more humble ſtile (as ſome love to call it) differ but in a verbal nicety: in the different manner of expreſſing the ſame thing, rather than in their different judgment upon the ſubſtance of the matter. So that excellent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, lately mentioned (Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>) hath clearly reſolved<note n="a" place="margin">Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy not prejudicial to Regal Power, p. 12, 13.</note>. For ſometimes this term <hi>Divine Right</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Divine Precept (which is the firſt and moſt proper ſignification) when it appeareth by ſome clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and peremptory
<hi>Command of God</hi> in his Word, to be the <hi>Will of God</hi> that the thing ſo commanded ſhould be perpetually and univerſally obſerved. And that the Government of the Church by Biſhops is of Divine Right in this ſtricter ſenſe is an Opinion, ſaith <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52831:44"/> he, at leaſt of great probability, and ſuch as may more eaſily and on better grounds be defended than confuted. But they that chuſe to ſpeak otherwiſe, underſtand by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for a thing from the
<hi>Inſtitution, Example,</hi> or <hi>Approbation</hi> either of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. which is a ſecondary meaning of the term, but not much diſtant from the former. For the Obſervation of the <hi>Lords Day</hi> depends on this Divine Right; and there is as much to ſhew (as he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 19.) if not more, for ſuch a Divine Right of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as for the Divine Right of
<hi>that day.</hi> So that whoſoever they be that either wave the term
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right,</hi> or elſe ſo expound it as not of neceſſity to import any more than an Apoſtolical Inſtitution;
<q>Yet the Apoſtles Authority<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> page 39, 40.</note> in the Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, being warranted by the Example, and (as they doubt not) by the direction of their Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily eſteem to be ſo reverend and obligatory; as that they would not <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52831:44"/> for a world have any hand in, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and deliberately contribute the leaſt aſſiſtance towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of that Government; but rather hold themſelves obliged in their Conſciences, to the utmoſt of their power, to endeavour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and continuance of it in theſe Churches, and do heartily wiſh the reſtitution and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame whereſoever it is not, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now that Epiſcopacy is of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſo of
<hi>Divine Right,</hi> he further adds<note n="c" place="margin">v. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 18.</note>, is in truth a part of the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>hath been conſtantly and uniformly maintain'd by our beſt Writers</hi> [mark theſe words] <hi>and by all the Sober, Orderly, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Sons of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew that there ought to be no ſuch diſtinction made, as we find in this man, between <hi>high</hi> and
<hi>low</hi> Conformiſts: ſince all have ſpoken to the ſame effect, and yet were no <hi>Swaſhbucklers,</hi> but, in this great <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52831:45"/> perſons opinion, the Sober, Orderly, and Orthodox Sons of the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But let us ſuppoſe there is ſome difference, yet they that have ſpoken the higheſt words of Epiſcopacy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought
<hi>Aerius a greater Heretick than</hi> Arius, <hi>nor had more Charity for thoſe that deny our Saviour's Deity, than for thoſe that ſcruple the ſtrict</hi> Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum <hi>of Epiſcopacy.</hi> No, this is a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion from the Father of lyes, the Calumniator of the Brethren, and ſeem to me to be the words of one whoſe tongue is ſet on fire of Hell. For though our beſt Divines have called it the <hi>Hereſie of Arius</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Doctor <hi>Cracken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſ.

<hi>ought</hi> to be no imparity in the Church, or diſtinction between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters; and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that this imparity was inſtituted and approved by the Apoſtles; yet they have declared withal, that they who think as <hi>Aerius</hi> did, are ſo far from being in a worſe caſe than
<hi>Arius</hi> was, that they are not in ſo bad. <hi>Let but obſtinacy and perverſeneſs be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will be no Hereſie; and if it be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52831:45"/> Hereſie (being about a point of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline) it will not be among thoſe which St.</hi> Peter <hi>calls damnable Hereſies</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> 3. Letter, p.

Theſe are the words of one who was as vehement an Aſſertor of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Epiſcopacy, as any hath been (and there are none among us but will ſubſcribe to them) who is ſo far, you ſee, from making <hi>Aerius</hi> a greater He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick than <hi>Arius,</hi> that his words plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make him leſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

That when for Decency, Order, or Uniformity ſake any conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made, there is the ſame neceſſity of obeying ſuch conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as of obeying other Laws made for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth concerning any other indifferent thing.

And, to add no more, 4. That ſuch neceſſity of Obedience notwithſtanding, the things remain in the ſame indifferency as before; every way as to their
<hi>Nature,</hi> and even in reſpect of us, thus far, That there is a liberty left for men upon extraordinary and other <hi>juſt</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,

28. where he tells <pb n="93" facs="tcp:52831:55"/> you, the <hi>chief Quarrel of the high Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchiſts againſt the Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> ſhould in reaſon have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, that <hi>they</hi> (who would have thought it?) <hi>were the firſt in bringing the King back.</hi> Which he joyns with a new cluſter of calumnies againſt <hi>many</hi> of the Biſhops, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Clergy: affirming (<hi>page</hi> 29.) that their own intereſt, it may be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, had a conſiderable influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Loyalty; and that they ſeem to expreſs more and greater zeal againſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> than againſt the <hi>Regicides, &amp;c.</hi> Who would not think, that reads this, that they were the men (who but they?) who kept life and heat in the Kings Cauſe, and that the Epiſcopal men, many of them, were cold and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent? or that they were the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> the <hi>well-affected</hi> to his Majeſty, and the others led by their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to follow the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> zeal for him? Nay, that they were the firſt movers towards the <hi>Kings</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, even before thoſe that were <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52831:56"/> always in motion, and never ceaſed their reſtleſs indeavours for it? O moſt glorious
<hi>Apologist!</hi> He may tell us next, as the men of <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid,
<hi>The King is near of kin to us,</hi> for that is as true, as that <hi>they were the firſt in bringing him back.</hi> If he will ſtand to this, and not have it paſs for a boaſt, but for a ſerious Truth; I will produce him the words of ſome of the heads of his party (which I had rather ſpare) that make it unlawful to attempt it. Whereby it will appear that they at leaſt were not for bringing him in again, till they were forced to it, by thoſe who would not let them keep him out.</p>
            <p>And now that he is in his Throne, methinks it is no great ſign of the contentment they take in the change, that the <hi>Conventicles,</hi> which are ſo frequent and numerous on other dayes, are obſerved to be ſo few, if any, upon the day of this Kings Return, or upon the day of the former Kings Death. Look about <pb n="95" facs="tcp:52831:56"/> you, and conſider all the private Meetings you know of on the Lords Day; How many did you ever know or hear of that will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe at the appointed times to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the horrid Murther of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or to thank God for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reſtauration of the <hi>Son?</hi> For my part, I have conſtantly obſerved, that thoſe which come within my knowledge, do not aſſemble on thoſe daies at all; and many others have made the ſame Obſervation as well as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>As for the other thing, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> expreſſing more and greater Zeal againſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
<hi>Regicides,</hi> and more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more fiercely arraigning and condemning the <hi>Covenant,</hi> than the <hi>Ingagement;</hi> the ſame Anſwer may ſerve which Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> gave to thoſe who complained that the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation Sermons</hi> were more againſt the
<hi>Puritans,</hi> than the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Preface to 1 Vol. of Serm. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. 8. 1657.</note>. Firſt, we ſay it is not altogether true: the <hi>Regicides</hi> have their ſhare
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52831:57"/> in the Publick Sermons (of which I ſuppoſe he ſpeaks) as well as their Fellows, as oft as the <hi>Text</hi> gives occaſion, or the file of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe leads the Preachers to it. And on thoſe Daies I mentioned, it is the General Complaint of your people that the Preachers ſpeak too much againſt thoſe <hi>King-killers</hi> and thoſe Principles which led them to commit that Sin without Bluſhing. But, Secondly, admitting it to be true to a tittle, either our men are
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable</hi> in what they blame them for, or they that blame them
<hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable,</hi> who do the very ſame thing.
<q>Do they not uſually (ſaith he) in their Sermons fall bitterly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> but ſeldome meddle with the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> ſcarce ever name the <hi>Turks?</hi> I have been told often of their Declamations againſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> that great ſuperſtitious thing, but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not to have heard of much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt <hi>Perjury and Sacriledge,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52831:57"/> and ſome other Sins wherewith our times abound. Nay, did not their Zeal even againſt <hi>Popery</hi> it ſelf ſeem to abate, when they had got moſt of the Pulpits into their Poſſeſſion; at leaſtwiſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Zeal they ſhewed againſt
<hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> the <hi>Liturgy, Feſtivals,</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> in uſe among us? Theſe they cried down with all the Noiſe they could, and with all the Strength they had: But why I beſeech you ſo zealous againſt them, which were (at the worſt they could fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie them) but leſſer Sins and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in compariſon with thoſe greater which now were little talkt of? I doubt not but they had ſome reaſons, wherewith to ſatisfie themſelves for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and be they what they will, if they will ſerve to excuſe them, they will ſerve as well to juſtifie our men, ſhould they do as they are charged. The beſt thing, I think, that can be alledged by a <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52831:58"/> rational man for ſuch a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this. That where people are more in danger to be ſeduced by a leſs Error or Sin (as it is conceived) than a greater, there more Pains and Zeal may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed to keep them from that than from the other, that is in it ſelf more dangerous. Thus our Saviour reproved the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees</hi> more frequently and with greater ſharpneſs than he did the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> though in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and in reſpect of their <hi>Matter,</hi> the Errors of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> were worſe than thoſe of the other; becauſe the <hi>Phariſees</hi> by reaſon of their outſide Holineſs were grown into better eſteem with the people than the
<hi>Sadducees</hi> were, and the generality of the Jews were better principled againſt the groſs Errors of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> than the inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Doctrines of the hypocritical <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All this is very good, and is the very Plea, which thoſe may juſtly <pb n="99" facs="tcp:52831:58"/> put in for themſelves who <hi>expreſs</hi> more and greater zeal againſt the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> than againſt the <hi>Regicides;</hi> and arraign the <hi>Covenant</hi> more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than the <hi>Engagement:</hi> there is more and greater need of it; the people being in more danger to be miſled by the one than by the other; and having a greater abhorrence of thoſe Crimes which are black and ugly, than of thoſe which are gilded over with ſpecious pretences.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> But this is not all the <hi>Hectoriſm</hi> he is guilty of; he makes a large boaſt of their great indulgence and charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Epiſcopal men when they had power, <hi>page</hi> 23. and deſires me to Catechiſe my ſelf why I charged them with <hi>rigour and ſeverity</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring their kindneſs to the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Armagh,</hi> and many others, <hi>p.</hi> 151.

Well, but the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, ſaith the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> had <hi>two hundred pound</hi> per annum <hi>allowed them by an Ordinance.</hi> Allowed?
<hi>Voted</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, and that is true; by the ſame token that they could never get it.

All this was over and above the many inſolent affronts put upon <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52831:60"/> him all this while, which you may read there if you pleaſe, <hi>page</hi> 62. which made that meek man conclude in theſe pathetical words<note n="l" place="margin">

For they ſpent what they had left for a feeble ſupport, in ſuing for that which they could never get; and ſometimes that which was lent by their Friends was thrown away, by this means, after that which was taken from them.

               <hi>You cannot ſay it is for the Reformed Religion, ſince you have not begun to reform your Church. You had thriven better if you had done as we did, begun at the Church.</hi>
               <q>A few days after this, new Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being made, their Friends in the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> made this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Will you joyn in Covenant with us to reform Doctrine and Diſcipline conform to this of</hi> Scotland? and ye ſhall have a better anſwer.

Nay, ſaid the Aſſembly again, this will be loſs of time, and the danger is great, the Parliament nor being able with all their forces to ſtand two months before the King; we will rather therefore draw up the Solemn League and Covenant here, and ſend up with you ſome Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Gentlemen, and Miniſters that

What they mean by a <hi>Primitive Epiſcopacy</hi> I will not ſtand to enquire; but this is well known, that the <hi>Three Miniſters</hi> in their firſt anſwer to the Divines of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> poſitively affirmed, <hi>That Epiſcopacy was not abjured by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion nor their Covenant</hi>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52831:68"/> contrivance, eſpecially if you call to mind, as the Anſwer tells him, how there was ſomething elſe agreed, <hi>viz.</hi> that twenty Divines of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties nomination being added to the Aſſembly ſhould have a free conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and debate about the ſettlement of Church-Government after thoſe three years or ſooner, if differences could be compoſed.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52831:74"/> it was with others, I have not had occaſion to obſerve, and now have not leiſure to examine; but have cauſe from this to ſuſpect that he doth not report theſe matters clearly and with ſincerity.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> And indeed, overweening of mens ſelves is apt to blinde them, and make them imagine any thing will paſs for truth and for ſound reaſon which comes out of their mouthes. One would wonder what he thinks our brains are made of, who puts us off with ſuch ſlender ſtuff as this, for an excuſe of their holding Meetings ſeparate from us. <hi>It is no ſchiſm, nor a breach of the unity of the Church, becauſe they take occaſion to meet for a time onely; till a door be opened for them in the Church, by the removal of ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or real corruption in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Worſhip.</hi> As if there were no breach in a garment when it is rent, becauſe it may be ſowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <pb n="127" facs="tcp:52831:74"/> again. But yet this the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> thinks, makes the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the
<hi>Non conformiſts</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not
<hi>total</hi> and <hi>perpetual,</hi> p. 11. which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats again, p. 128. and calls it <hi>a temporary and partial withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> A very ſorry employment this is, for a Divine (as I take him to be) to ſpend his time in ſowing a few fig-leaves together to cover the ſhame of a ſinful diſobedience to their Governours, and the great breach they have made in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church. For it may be demonſtrated from his own words that this is a meer ſhift and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excuſe. He confeſſes a
<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;</hi> onely he addes that it is but temporary. The cauſe of this <hi>temporary Separation</hi> is <hi>a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or real corruption in the publike Worſhip.</hi> I ask now, Is this corruption ſuch (whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or ſuppoſed) that it is a juſt cauſe for a Separation? If it be not, they ought not to withdraw <pb n="128" facs="tcp:52831:75"/> themſelves for a time. If it be, they may withdraw themſelves from us alway. And ſo they will according to theſe Principles: for if this corruption be not removed, they muſt alway continue ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſe it is no ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſeparating now. Do what they can, they are not like the old Nonconformiſts; for they did not withdraw themſelves into ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bodies, no not for a time. If they had upon his Principles, they muſt have died
<hi>Separatiſts</hi> (there being no removal of what they wiſhed taken out of the way) as theſe men are like to do, unleſs they repent and alter their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in ſtead of deſiring an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Publick Worſhip. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he is very ignorant of the ſtate of our affairs, who doth not know it hath been the manner of this Sect to proceed from evil to worſe ſince the very beginning of it: which makes me think it paſt doubt that they will ſettle in a <pb n="129" facs="tcp:52831:75"/> down-right Separation. At the firſt they onely diſliked ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,<note place="margin">See the Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpeech at <hi>Liſne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garvy,</hi> p. 5.</note> and could pretty well digeſt conformity in the reſt. In a little time they manifeſted a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of Epiſcopal Government, being better affected to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mr. <hi>Calvin:</hi> and together with that, they diſtaſted alſo our Common prayer. From a diſlike Some proceeded to think them unlawful, and then fell into a contempt of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> bitterly rayling againſt them. From hence they advanced to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen diſobedience to all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, and at laſt renounced it, and rent themſelves from it, eſteeming themſelves the onely Brethren and Congregation of the Faithful. Some there were indeed that did not go thus far; and being ſilenced or deprived for not conforming to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, would not ſeparate from the Church, nor refuſed to joyn with our Aſſemblies. This Apologiſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52831:76"/> would have us think that he and his Brethren are the followers of thoſe: and yet confeſſes they are gone a large ſtep beyond them, having <hi>ſeparated for a time.</hi> And the ſame reaſon which hath carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them thus far, will advance them further, and make that
<hi>time</hi> ſo long, that it will prove <hi>alway.</hi> They will teach next, that <hi>Gods people muſt be Separatiſts</hi>

            <p>But it may be further added, that the Catechiſm he mentions, did not come forth till the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="145" facs="tcp:52831:83"/> was too far gone; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever had been ſaid then, would but have been to ſhut the Stable-door, when the Steed was ſtoln.

<hi>Perjury;</hi> and yet there was no Preaching againſt it, till the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant came to be broken, though it was a ſin before that time wherewith the Land abounded. <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52831:84"/> As for the <hi>Authors</hi> of the

The reſt of the maintenance of the Clergy was in danger, the very Tythes being envied to them; which made it high time to ſay ſomething to keep themſelves from being undone, after they had ruined the Biſhops.</p>

            <p>For ſetting aſide his calumnies; his unjuſt complaints of railing, jeering, and what not? his falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties boldly aſſerted, his miſtakes <pb n="147" facs="tcp:52831:84"/> of the Queſtion; his impertinent allegation of Authorities; his idle ſtories, frivolous obſervations, uncharitable ſurmiſes, and odious inſinuations; his miſ-repreſenting of my words, his cropping or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging them; his falſe gloſſes and commentaries, and ſuch like things; I can finde very little that looks like ſo much as an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a <hi>direct Anſwer.</hi> If you be not weary, I pray obſerve a few things on ſome of thoſe Heads. What a frivolous obſervation is that out of the <hi>Rhemiſh Teſtament,</hi> about the retaining of old words; which you may read in him, if you will, (p. 42.) for I ſhall not ſtand to recite it? There being nothing plainer, then that neither they nor we refuſe to uſe the words <hi>Amen, Faſting, Charity, the bleſſed Sacrament, Alleluja,</hi> and others there mentioned, and yet are in no danger to believe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth; nor ſhould we, though we ſhould uſe the <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52831:85"/> words <hi>Altar, Oblation</hi> and

This is the man that makes <hi>ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> upon the Debate; juſt like the <hi>ſerious</hi> prayer of one of their preſent Preachers, who in the preſence of a numerous Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, uſed theſe words to God; which ſound more like that Ryme then any Sermon that ever I heard. <hi>Thou art the hope of our help, and the help of our hope; thou art our hope when we have no help, and thou art our help when we have no hope; yea, thou art our hope and our help, when we have neither hope nor help, but are helpleſs and hopeleſs.</hi> I ſhould not have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52831:85"/> this, but that there are ſo many witneſſes of it; and to ſhow you what may be done, if they will have us proceed in this way of writing.</p>
            <p>No, by no means, I know you will ſay, let us have no more of this ſtuff. I am very well pleaſed with the motion: and wiſh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would not ground their replies upon hear ſays, when they may believe their eyes. Let him not give any credit to him, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be, that ſaith,<note place="margin">See pag. 101. of his Book.</note> 
               <hi>I dealt diſingenuouſly</hi> with Mr. <hi>Bridg</hi> in my quotations of him, but look into his Book, and make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to me that I have wreſted his words, and I will confeſs it, and make him the beſt amends I am able. It is as eaſie, I ſhould think, for a Scholar to ſit in his Study and read Books, as to gad up and down to hear and tell idle ſtories. But let not the Books he reads be cited impertinently, as the very Articles of the Church of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52831:86"/> 
               <hi>England</hi> are by him. An inſtance you have (and it is the firſt that comes to hand, but the reſt are like it) <hi>p.</hi>
87. For I never thought that the Fathers <hi>looked for no more then tranſitory promiſes:</hi> But that it was not by vertue of the Covenant made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they looked for more, I did and do affirm. A great many of the Worthies mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. lived before the Law was given, and the reſt that followed them built their expectation on the ſame ground which they did. But we may well paſs by ſuch vain alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations out of the Articles, ſince the very Scriptures which he cites confute all that he ſaith. If <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt,</hi> for inſtance, and <hi>believing</hi> in him be all one, which is apparent indeed from
<hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38. (cited by him, <hi>p.</hi> 79.) then believing in Chriſt is more then <hi>relying on him for pardon of ſins;</hi> for to
<hi>come to Christ,</hi> is to become one of his Diſciples, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52831:86"/> to be of his Religion. This is have cleared ſufficiently in the <hi>laſt Debate;</hi> and ſhown withal, that obedience to the Law of God is a <hi>condition of our Justification. No,</hi> ſaith this Gentleman, out of I know not what Author, <hi>p.</hi> 78. <hi>It is not the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſo properly as of thoſe perſons that enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Which is a monſtrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. Anſwer to this Queſtion: no better then to affirm and deny the ſame thing in the ſame breath. For if it be the ſame condition and qualification of thoſe perſons that enter into the Covenant, then it is the condition of their Juſtification, which they obtain by entring into Covenant with God ſo qualified. As for the words themſelves, without relation to the Queſtion, they are right enough, if they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not to deny our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be a condition required <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> the Covenant, though it
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52831:87"/> be not ſo proper to ſay a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of</hi> the Covenant. For how comes our obedience to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary condition or qualification of the perſons entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but by the Covenant? That requires it, and doth not promiſe Juſtification without it; and therefore is a Condition <hi>in</hi> the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>But I have neither liſt nor lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to trace his ſteps in theſe things; which I would wiſh him not to meddle withal, till he know where the very pinch of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie lyes, &amp; then we may end it one way or other in a few words.</p>
            <p>Let him forbear alſo his <hi>odious inſinuations,</hi> as that I think the <hi>Papiſts good ſubjects, p.</hi> 67, ſuggeſt the <hi>N.

There are no ſuch things <pb n="153" facs="tcp:52831:87"/> ſaid or intimated in my Book. And yet he himſelf dare not ſay that he knows no
<hi>N.C.</hi> that refuſe to joyn in it ſolely or chiefly on that account, but that he knows <hi>ſcarce one intelligent N. C.</hi> Very likely. He may know, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, multitudes of ſilly ones; and here and there one whom he takes to be <hi>intelligent.</hi> But this is nothing to what this
<hi>intelligent</hi> Non-conformiſt ſuggeſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meetings of Dr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and others in the late times, for Common-prayer; as if they were as much <hi>Conventicles</hi> as any now, <hi>p.</hi> 68. Whereas they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> and not againſt it: unleſs he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Ordinances</hi> were Law, as much as <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament. If that ſtill lye at the bottom of their hearts, let them ſpeak out. But who can believe that the <hi>High Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have not all, and alway been ſo conſtant and firm to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King and Parliament, as <pb n="154" facs="tcp:52831:88"/> they ought?</hi> Or is it likely that that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was ill affected to Kingly Authority, or diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Superiours? So he would have you think, becauſe of one paſſage in a Book of that Doctors (as you may ſee, <hi>p.</hi> 81, 82.) from whom he takes a meaſure of the reſt. If he had known more, he would, I doubt not, have been ſo kind as to beſtow it upon us: but this ſingle ſpeech was all he had in his Budget. If you peaſe therefore, I will furniſh him with ſome other as bold ſpeeches (let him make what he can of them) concerning the actions of thoſe times, as any in Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> Who ſhould have expreſſed his minde in leſs offenſive terms; having no meaning, I verily believe, to charge the King, who was then very young, with any guilt, but onely thoſe greedy perſons, who had poſſeſſed him with no better Principles.

So he would have it thought; elſe why doth he oppoſe my words and the eleventh Article of our Religion the one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52831:94"/> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 85. The comfort of it is, there is no claſhing at all between them, but onely in his own brains; which underſtand not, it ſeems, that good Works may be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our juſtification, and yet no cauſe of it. But thus he deals with me in other things: what I ſaid of <hi>Lawn-ſleeves,</hi> and the Black Cap and White (<hi>firſt part,</hi> p. 81) he tranſlates to <hi>Surpleſſes,</hi> and makes an idle diſcourſe about them, <hi>p.</hi> 47. He makes you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſaid that
<hi>afternoon-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were wholly ſuperfluous,</hi> p. 61. when I onely told you that they might be uſed or not, as they ſhould be found to be to Edification. The ſame perverſe repreſentation he makes of what I ſaid about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, <hi>p.</hi> 70. Preaching of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>p.</hi> 77. Doing good out of fear of threatnings, <hi>p.</hi> 84. Pious diſcourſes alſo, <hi>p.</hi> 96. which were not by me diſgraced, but their raſh cenſures condemned. If I did not begin to be tyred with <pb n="167" facs="tcp:52831:94"/> following him in his rambles, I could preſent you with a great many more Monſters of his own making; juſt like that which a Cheat promiſed to ſhow his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous ſpectators (they are the words of one whom he and I have often mentioned) an Horſe whoſe Head ſtood in the place of his Tail; and when all came to all, he himſelf had tyed the Horſe to the Manger the wrong way. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, barely to ſhow theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations, would be a very dull buſineſs, and indanger the tiring you quite; and to make them appear ridiculous, would much offend his ſeriouſneſs. For which reaſon, I ſhall let theſe (and a great many other things in his Book) alone, till he give me a further occaſion.</p>
            <p>But I intreat him, as he loves himſelf, to hold his hand till he hath learnt a little more Logick, and knows better how to draw conſequences. At leaſt, let him <pb n="168" facs="tcp:52831:95"/> forbear to draw any out of my Books, till he hath diligently weighed every word, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it. For his manner is to make very ſilly ones, and then confute them, as you may read in his Preface, and <hi>p.</hi> 107, 108. Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vicars did thus and thus heretofore, therefore the</hi> N.C. <hi>are all thus and thus now. It this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>good Logick, and ſolid reaſoning?</hi> I ſay no; it is childiſh and ridiculous: but it is his own, not mine; who produced ſuch mens ſayings to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. And I perceive it is his manner to draw Univerſals from Particulars. For preſently after, asking
<hi>Whether the</hi> N. C. <hi>ſhortly look to ſhut Heaven, and turn the waters into blood?</hi> He tells you Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> of <hi>N. England</hi> (whoſe words I cited) ſaith no: and ſo all the <hi>N. C.</hi> muſt be concluded to be of his minde. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>the Church of</hi> Scotland, he tells you, <hi>had as few Hereſies, as <pb n="169" facs="tcp:52831:95"/> any other, p.</hi> 139. Therefore; What? Then the <hi>N. C.</hi> were not the cauſe of the ſtrange and new Doctrines,, Opinions, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical words and Phraſes in Preaching and Writing. For this is part of his Anſwer to the Queſtion,
<hi>Whether they be ſo or no.</hi> In time they may improve this way of arguing very much, as ſome did in the late times, when they told us<note n="b" place="margin">Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, 1645. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note>; <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Athenians, whilſt they were Free-ſtates, bred ten to one more vertuous and illustrious men, then other Governments, or even they themſelves at other times.</hi> You know the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And you may know alſo what horrid Doctrines were broached in <hi>Scotland,</hi> more then any where elſe, deſtructive to all Government: and that all the Sectaries in
<hi>England</hi> were the Spawn of thoſe who ſtood diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to our Church; nay, that <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelf and his mad <pb n="170" facs="tcp:52831:96"/> Companions (though diſclaimed by them when they ſaw their end) ſprung out of their ſociety; frequented their Sermons, and were their Aſſociates, before they entred into thoſe Frantick courſes, as I can prove from good Authority. As alſo, that they are juſtly compared to the
<hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> though that Sect were great ſticklers for Ceremonies, and their Traditions: as they for their own Inventions. But for the preſent, let him read Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Sermon lately printed. And not trouble us with his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for leſs Uniformity then there is among us, upon this ground, that we have not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Uniformity in all things: which is a thing that is not to be here expected. Yet this piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reaſoning he repeats again and again: like to that of Dr. <hi>Busby</hi>'s reading Logick ſometimes to his Scholars, to prepare them for the Univerſity: therefore,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52831:96"/> the <hi>N. C.</hi> may read a whole Circle of Philoſophy, to keep Youths from going to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and to make the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there unneceſſary, <hi>p.</hi> 123. For there lyes the point: and he needed not have referred us to what ſome able men told him about the Oath, and the words of it at <hi>Oxford.</hi> For it is in print among the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity-Statutes<note n="c" place="margin">

               <note n="d" place="margin">Ib. p. 163.</note>. Now it will be found, I take it, that they who give that Oath, intend not to prohibit the ſetting up of another Univerſity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to take Degrees (which is not in the power of him that ſwears)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52831:97"/> but the keeping Schools for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity-Learning, with intention to perfect Scholars there, and on purpoſe to keep them from the Univerſities.</p>

            <p>I Had no ſooner run over this Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Catechiſm, and made a few Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on it, but I received a <hi>Caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> from you, wherein I am alſo concern'd.

               <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 128, 129. edit. 1</note> of our <hi>Debate,</hi> and judged it very unbecoming ſuch frail underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as ours, to go about to unfold the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of high Providence, and aſſigne the cauſes and reaſons of thoſe particular cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which befal their neighbours. Nay, common prudence I thought would have taught any conſidering man to forbear the making ſuch obſervations, as may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to any purpoſe, even againſt thoſe that make them: inſomuch that they who have ſerved themſelves by ſuch arguments, when it comes to their own turn to ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can by no means endure to hear of them. And yet, behold, a grave
<hi>Caſuiſt</hi> come forth, who not onely ſpells, but thinks he can read the meaning of Divine Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the late Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> who is not ſuffered now to live in it. He hath pickt it out of his own Letter left at <pb n="177" facs="tcp:52831:99"/> his departure out of the Realm, in which he acknowledges that <hi>his Credit had been very little ſince that Seſſion of Parliament which was at Oxford.</hi> What of all that? Why, he was the Contriver of that <hi>Act,</hi> ſays the interpreter of Providence, which baniſhed Others from their houſes; after which his Authority dwindled ſo much, that at laſt he was forced to leave his own houſe. As much as to ſay, if you will have the ſenſe of this Privie Counſellor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in plain words, <hi>God puniſhes him now for all that he did againſt them.</hi> No, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paps you will ſay, <hi>againſt God:</hi> for ſo the words run in his Prayer for him which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows, <hi>Do not thou, O God, for all he hath done againſt thee,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you underſtand the meaning of their words, and their opinion of themſelves better, then not to know that what is done <hi>againſt them,</hi> is, as they conſtrue it, done <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God:</hi> and ſo whatever Calamity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls any man after he hath oppoſed them, it is the hand of God avenging the quarrel of his people. Thus Mr. <hi>Baily,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in that Book which I have oft had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mention, talks of <hi>ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which God from heaven <hi>viſibly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>

Firſt of all, in the time of <hi>Leo Iſaurus,</hi> after the Images of the Saints were burnt in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there enſued a Peſtilence in which died three hundred thouſand people.

In the times alſo of <hi>Conſtantinus Copronymus,</hi> another enemy of Images, entire Cities were overthrown by <hi>Earthquakes;</hi> a grievous
<hi>Peſtilence</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo that there was ſcarce room to bury the dead. And that there might be no doubt, ſaith the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> for what cauſe theſe things happened, there were at the <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52831:101"/> ſame time <hi>little Croſſes</hi> to be ſeen on the garments of men, and the Prieſts veſtments, as if they had been drawn with oyl. There was ſuch an horrible <hi>Cold</hi> alſo, that the <hi>Pontick Sea</hi> was frozen for an hundred miles together, and the <hi>Ice</hi> was thirty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits thick; upon which a <hi>Snow</hi> fell twenty Cubits in depth: and when a Thaw came, great pieces of this Ice like Mountains or Iſlands ſwam up and down with great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; and ſome daſhing againſt the walls of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> broke down a part of them, and overturn'd the adjoyning hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And yet the calamities were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, but a great
<hi>Drought</hi> followed all this, ſo that Fountains, Wells and Rivers were dryed up. Whereby all might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſaith this Roman Diviner, that God was angry at their impiety againſt him and againſt his <hi>Saints.</hi> For laſtly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> himſelf, that obſtinate Emperour, died wretchedly; when on the contrary, they that with the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> ſtood up for <hi>Images</hi> and defended them, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to Kingdom and Empire, lived proſperouſly and reigned happily. What an heap of Obſervations are here to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that which you ſo much abhor? Who can chuſe but take notice how God declared himſelf from heaven by all theſe

<hi>Images?</hi> When do you read of ſo many and ſo great misfortunes and dreadful Calamities in any age, as theſe upon the haters of <hi>Images;</hi> which point, as it were with the finger, to you that they ought to be worſhipped? If you like not this kinde of arguing, I pray let it alone your ſelves. Let us not hear any more of the ſad things which befal any particular men, as if they were upon the ſcore of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing or puniſhing Nonconformiſts.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> This is ſufficient to ſhew what may be expected from this New Undertaker: who will appear, I doubt not, as lame in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſonings as he doth in this; and prove as unfit to determine
<hi>Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as to <hi>make Obſervations</hi> upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For firſt, he doth not fairly and candidly repreſent that which I ſaid, but accuſes me of ſuch Reſolutions in matters of Conſcience, as never came into my thoughts. I am beholden to him, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, for ſome good words, and for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion of me; but I could have been well content to have wanted them, on condition he would not have ſaid, that <hi>I am ſo unkind, and ſo unconſcionably untender, as to account that no man who tranſgreſſes an Act of Parliament can be a good Chriſtian</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">In the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the firſt page.</note>; nor askt, Whether <hi>indeed I think that every tranſgreſſion of a Realm is no leſs then a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52831:102"/> ſin?</hi> There was no occaſion for this Queſtion, or for that Cenſure: unleſs he be of the opinion that all ſins are equal, ſo that what a man ſaith concerning the <hi>open breach,</hi> and
<hi>contempt</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Law, is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all tranſgreſſions whatſoever of <hi>any</hi> Law. I never ſaid that no man can be a good Chriſtian that tranſgreſſes an Act of Parliament, nor that <hi>every</hi> tranſgreſſion of a Statute is a <hi>deadly ſin.</hi> Theſe are inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own, upon occaſion onely of a ſingle inſtance which I gave of <hi>Defiance</hi> to a Law wherein ſome men <hi>live</hi> (mark my words<note n="g" place="margin">Friendly Debate, p. 3.

<hi>Caſe</hi> concerning the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of humane Laws: which, as I take it, depends upon this ſingle point, <hi>Whether humane Laws binde the Conſcience?</hi> that is, whether we ſin, if we be not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them? In the reſolving of which he that findes no di<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ficulty, may well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he doth not fully underſtand it. For if, on the one ſide, we ſay that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not concerned; I beſeech you what <pb n="184" facs="tcp:52831:103"/> is? Nothing but our common diſcretion to keep our ſelves out of the reach of the Princes Sword; whoſe anger and power we may dread, but whoſe commands we need not care a ſtraw for. And if on the other ſide, we ſay that Conſcience is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and obliged by their Laws, then there may follow great perplexities, when any thing is commanded that proves a common and an intolerable grievance. More difficulties I need not mention of this nature; there being no diſpute about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to do ſinful things: but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply my diſcourſe to the Queſtion. And for all that which was laſt ſaid, ſince there is no greater miſchief then diſobedience to Laws, and nothing can ſo certainly ſecure obedience, as a ſenſe of duty; we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that a man is bound to make a conſcience of obſerving the Laws of his Governours, which are not contrary to the Laws of God. So the holy Scripture it ſelf teaches us to ſpeak, when it requires us, and makes it
<hi>neceſſary, to be ſubject for conſcience ſake, and not onely for wrath,</hi> Rom. 13.5. that is, out of a ſenſe that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be innocent, and preſerve a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God, unleſs we be obſervant of their Laws, where we are not pre-inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a higher Authority then theirs.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52831:103"/> The very ſame is included in thoſe words, which require our ſubmiſſion <hi>to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. which if we do not yield, it is manifeſt, the diſobedience is a violation of a General precept of God exacting our obedience to them. Inſomuch that to ſet a mans ſelf in oppoſition to their Laws, is by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to oppoſe the Almighty: according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Yes, ſaith this Caſuiſt; but will you pronounce thus without any diſtinction? Doth a man commit a deadly ſin every time that he tranſgreſſes an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I anſwer, That's without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Queſtion. We are not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the degrees of ſin, which are of more or leſs guilt according as the <hi>Law</hi> is of greater or leſſer concernment, and as a mans <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of it, is with modeſtie, or with a high hand: nor are we conſidering when, and in what caſes, a Law may ceaſe to oblige, and quite alters its nature: but whether while it doth oblige, and is in force, it lays a tye on the Conſcience or no, and whether all Laws do ſo or no. And to this we ſay, Yes; [Laws while they are obligatory do binde the Conſcience] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52831:104"/> the Scripture ſaith ſo: and we ſay ſo
<hi>indefinitely,</hi> becauſe that's the Scripture-language alſo. But ſtay a little; this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman cannot believe that. The Scripture ſaith the Magiſtrate is <hi>Gods miniſter to us for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. Very true; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes that an argument why we ſhould be obedient to him, becauſe it is much for our profit and benefit. But this <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> turns the words quite another way, and makes them an outlet to diſobedience: by taking that to include an <hi>Exception</hi> to the General precept of ſubjection, which is in truth Nothing but a <hi>Reaſon</hi> to inforce it. To countenance which interpretation, he tears a little patch out of Biſhop
<hi>Taylor</hi>'s Rule of Conſcience, and would draw him into confederacie with him: who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates indeed thoſe words of the Apoſtle to the illuſtration of a particular caſe, but never intended any ſuch uſe of them as this man makes; as is apparent from the entire Body of his diſcourſe, and ſhall be touched afterward. Now let us hear this mans
<hi>Exception.</hi> If the Magiſtrate, ſaith he, command that which is for the peoples <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>welfare,</hi> they are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey him: otherwiſe they are not bound in conſcience, but for wrath ſake; <pb n="187" facs="tcp:52831:104"/> that is, becauſe they dare not do as they would and as they may. Very well: But who ſhall judge of that; I mean, whether a Law be for the Publike good, or no? His Anſwer is ready at his tongues end, (for he need not go deep for it) <hi>The Magiſtrate muſt judge what is for the Publick good as to the MAKING of the Law: and we muſt judge as to our OBEDIENCE to it.</hi> Then which it is hard to write any thing more inconſiderate or dangerous, and it declares to me, that he did not underſtand or minde the meaning of the words which he wrote. For what do we mean by a <hi>Law?</hi> Doth not the very form or eſſence of it (as the Caſuiſts ſpeak) conſiſt in the Precept or the Command of the Law-giver? If ſo; then that which we call a <hi>Law</hi> is not meerly the
<hi>ſignification</hi> of his <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> that he thinks ſuch a thing to be good or bad for us: but a <hi>declaration</hi> of his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> that we ſhould do that good or avoid that evil which he commands us to do or avoid: And, God having given him this authority to command us, this <hi>declaration</hi> carries with it an obligatory vertue to bind us to the execution of his will, under the pain of ſin. Nor is it of any moment, as to the obligation, whether there be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatned or not by him to the <pb n="188" facs="tcp:52831:105"/> diſobedient. For the puniſhment is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary onely by conſequence, and upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the people may be negligent and refractory to the will of the Law-giver, unleſs they be moved to comply with that which he thinks neceſſary to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by fear of puniſhment. To <hi>make a Law</hi> then is to declare to us his will to lay ſuch an obligation upon us. When this is done, we are no longer free whether we will do accordingly or no. If we be, the very nature of a Law is taken away, and every man is left to his own will. That which we call a <hi>Law,</hi> is but onely the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>opinion</hi> concerning that which <hi>he</hi> judges to be for the Publike good; and ſo he is turned into a private perſon, and made like one of his ſubjects; for they obey not his judgement and pleaſure, but their own. And if he puniſh them for diſobeying <hi>his,</hi> that is onely a ſigne that he is ſtronger then they, who ſuffer unjuſtly for doing well, not for doing ill.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> But let us hear his <hi>reaſon</hi> for this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deciſion; which he hath as ready as he had his <hi>Anſwer. Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God hath made every man judge of his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> What then? That you muſt ſeek by looking back, if perchance you may finde <pb n="185" facs="tcp:52831:105"/> ſome Conſequent of which this is the cauſe. The Queſtion, you remember, was, Who ſhall judge what Laws are for the Peoples Weal, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Common Good of them all? Why, the Magiſtrate may judge thus far, as to make Laws; but the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt judge, as to their obedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are not bound to do any thing he bids them, unleſs they think it is for their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Why ſo?
<hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>every man is made by God the Judge of his own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> I cannot for my life ſee how that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from this, though I have put his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning into the plaineſt form that ever I could. Which is this: God hath made every man judge of his own Actions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath made him judge what Laws are for the Peoples Weal, before he obey them. If he can ſhew me the neceſſary connexion of theſe two, and that the former infers the latter, I ſhall acknowledge that he is a deep man, and much beyond my reach. But they ſeem to me ſo widely diſtant, that one can never paſs from the one to the other by the longeſt train of Conſequences. That you may think indeed is the fault of the ſhortneſs of my Diſcourſe, which will not bring me within view of this Truth: For he reckons me to be ſuch a pitiful Gameſter, that I am not reflective (as he ſpeaks<note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 3.</note>) upon <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52831:106"/> more removes than one of thoſe many I ought to ſee. It may be ſo, and I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of my own weakneſs; yet I have done my endeavour to comprehend him, and to fathom the bottom of his deep Diſcourſe, which ſeems to me ſhorter and more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than he thinks mine. For he doth not reflect on that which is juſt next to what he hath ſaid and lies cloſe to it; whilſt he ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to that which lies ſo far off that no
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves</hi> will bring him to it. Let him try, if he pleaſe: And begin with this Principle, <hi>God hath made every man judge of his own Actions;</hi> which may be put into theſe more intelligible words, <hi>God hath made every man to determine whether that which he doth be conformable to his Rule, which is the Law or Will of his Creator.</hi> Now what is next to this?
<hi>Therefore,</hi> according to this Caſuiſt, <hi>He hath made every man to determine what Laws are for the Publick Good before he obey them.</hi> Doth this follow the other? No ſuch matter. The immediate Conſequent of that Principle is this, therefore he hath made him to determine, whether that which Humane Laws enjoyn be not croſs to his Rule, the Law of God. Now whither will this carry us, or what lies next to it? This; I take it, That if what Humane Laws enjoyn be not controlled by that higher Law, he is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52831:106"/> by his very Rule of life to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in that Point. Whether it be for the Publick Good or no that he ſhould do it, is another thing, out of the compaſs of his Judgment; God having made another Judge of that, <hi>viz.</hi> his Prince, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Ruler of all. Who by the vety <hi>making a Law</hi> determines what is for the Publick Good, and obliges us, as hath been ſaid already, to comply with it by virtue of Gods Law which requires our ſubjection to him. This is implied in the very term of
<hi>making a Law:</hi> And therefore it is not ſenſe to ſay, He ſhall judge what is good as to the making a Law, and we as to obedience; for he doth not only <hi>judge,</hi> but <hi>enjoyn</hi> when he makes a Law. Which leaves us no liberty but that which he cannot take away (becauſe given us by him, that gave him his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) to judge whether his Will and Gods do not claſh together. When this is known and determined, we have no more to do, unleſs we will place our ſelves in the Throne, and become Sovereigns, by determining other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning the Publick Welfare than the Proper Judge of it doth. Which in this Nation would be the more inſolent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable, Becauſe there is nothing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined here to be for the Peoples good, and paſſes into a Law for them, but by the advice, <pb n="188" facs="tcp:52831:107"/> deſire, and conſent of thoſe whom the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves chuſe to repreſent them, and to conſider and judge what is moſt conducing to their Welfare. This is plain reaſon; and whatſoever inconveniences may enſue from hence, they ſhall be conſidered afterward: And ſhould there be no way found to avoid them, they will appear not to be ſo great, as to reſolve in general terms, as this man doth, that they who are to obey, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Publick Orders and Decrees, are to judge themſelves what is for the Publick Good. Mark I pray you, whither theſe <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> drive. Other
<hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> have abſolved the People from all Laws about Church matters: And here now is one ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up to teach them how to free themſelves, if they pleaſe, from all Civil Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Realm. None ſhall bind but ſuch as they think good: That is, every man is made a
<hi>King</hi> and Governour himſelf. The danger of which determination I ſhall a little lay before you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Firſt, it is certainly no eaſie thing to judge what is beſt for the Peoples good: But <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves find it neceſſary to have their Council to deliberate and adviſe them to that which will promote it, which they declare to their People by their
<hi>Laws.</hi> And <pb n="189" facs="tcp:52831:107"/> if they did not, the Publick Welfare would be but little regarded, though we ſuppoſed every man better able to anderſtand it than he is.</p>
            <p>For <hi>(ſecondly)</hi> when men do know what is conducing to it, they will not preſently do it, if their preſent private Intereſt incline them otherways. From which two grounds <hi>Plato</hi> I remember derives the neceſſity of <hi>Laws.</hi> There are few private perſons that know what is moſt profitable for Common Life, and of thoſe that know, fewer can or will do it, unleſs the will of a Superiour Power be ſignified to them and oblige them to it. It is not hard indeed to know what will pleaſe themſelves, and may make for their own private utility: But what will make for the General Good, that is difficult for them to comprehend, and more difficult to bring them to do it, becauſe they are not inclined to prefer the good of all before that of their own Private Perſons. No, <hi>Mortal Nature</hi>

               <hi>hath a violent Propenſion to covet and draw all to its particular ſelf; always flying, after a brutiſh manner, that which it feels grievous, and purſuing that which is pleaſant and delightful.</hi> For which reaſon <hi>Law</hi> is needful to bound, direct, and govern him; ſince of himſelf he will not mind the Publick Good. If indeed men were of ſuch <pb n="190" facs="tcp:52831:108"/> a nature, ſaith he, that they underſtood the Common Good, and had ſuch a portion of Divinity in them, that they would alway follow it, they would ſtand in need of no <hi>Law:</hi> For that would be better than any Law or Order whatſoever. But ſince it is rare to find ſuch men; we muſt make the World as good as we can, by making them ſubject to a better and more diſintereſſed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than their own, which is the Publick <hi>Order and Law</hi>

                  </gap>.</note>. And whoſoever he be that makes every man judge of what is for the <hi>Peoples Weal,</hi> that man takes away the principal Power of the Magiſtrate. For he ſuppoſes the People <hi>able</hi> to judge of that; and if they be, there is no need of any Law; and conſequently of no Law-giver.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, they are ſo far from being <hi>able</hi> to judge what is for the Publick good, that the wiſeſt and beſt Princes with their Councils find it very difficult; and in many Caſes are a long time conſidering about it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to a reſolution. And that, though they have the help of thoſe who have been long verſed in affairs of this nature, and it is their buſineſs on which they attend; they have nothing elſe to mind unleſs they pleaſe, and information comes to them from all parts, which every private man cannot have; but as he hath ſomething elſe to do, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:52831:108"/> ſo he can know but a few of thoſe things which are to be conſidered in the caſe. Good and evil, gain and loſs, advantage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage (as that excellent Biſhop<note n="m" place="margin">Replic. to Biſh. of <hi>Chalcedon. p.</hi> 235, 236</note> I have ſo often cited may teach him) ought not to be weighed or eſteemed from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of one or two Circumſtances or Emergents.
<q>All Charges, Damages, and Repriſes muſt firſt be caſt up and deducted before one can give a right eſtimate of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or loſs. If a Merchant reckon only the Price which his Commodity coſt him beyond the Sea, without accounting Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, Freight, and other Charges, he will impoveriſh himſelf, when he thinks he hath ſold it to good profit. If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit alſo be only Temporal, and the loſs Spiritual (which few think of) as to gain Gold and loſe Faith, which is more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Gold that periſheth, it is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, whatever a man imagines, but loſs and damage. The <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Kingdom</hi> are one and the ſame Society of men, differing not <hi>Really,</hi> but
<hi>Rationally</hi> one from another, in reſpect of ſome diſtinct Relations. And that which is truly good for the <hi>Kingdom of England</hi> cannot be ill for the <hi>Church of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> nor that which is truly good for the Engliſh Church be ill for the Engliſh Kingdom.</q>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:52831:109"/> But yet, alaſs! how hard is it to comprehend what is good for both, and how few can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it? When ſo <hi>many men</hi> are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in <hi>different relations,</hi> and there are ſo <hi>many things</hi> and circumſtances that muſt be conſidered to make them happy in both <hi>thoſe relations;</hi> and when their good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depend not upon what is done for them in one, but in both, nor in a reſpect to a few Circumſtances, but to all: any of which if they be wanting, it is not good, but evil. I need not mention the Rule for this, which is commonly known: but ask now, what ſhall be done when there are ſo many things to be conſidered, which will coſt ſo much time and pains to weigh, before we can know what will make for the Publick Good? Shall a Private man (whom we now ſuppoſe to have the liberty which this Caſuiſt gives) judge without conſidering or attending to all thoſe things which the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate had a regard to in making his Law? This is very hard, that a Publick Decree, ſtanding on ſuch good grounds, ſhould be thrown down by one that knows them not. And how ill will the Publick Good be provided for at this rate, by thoſe that know little what belongs to it? Or ſhall we ſuppoſe every Private man to be of quicker diſpatch than their Governours, able to run <pb n="193" facs="tcp:52831:109"/> over all things that are to be conſidered with more ſpeed than they can do? That's very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, if you reflect upon all that hath been ſaid; and that they have not thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of knowing neither what is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as Publick perſons have. Or, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, muſt the Prince be content to wait till his Subjects have found means to know all that he doth, and till they have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, and till they be ſatisfied that his Law is for the Publick Good, before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any obedience from them? What then ſhall become of the Publick Good all that time which they take to think of the buſineſs? And who knows how long it will be before they are informed and have conſidered all things? And what if they be ſo ſcrupulous as never to be ſatisfied, becauſe for any thing they know there is more to be conſidered than they have yet heard of? Beſides; there are ſome Laws which require ſpeed and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in the execution: Muſt all theſe ſtand ſuſpended, no body knows how long, till the Subjects be agreed they are for the Publick Good? Muſt the Equity, Fitneſs, and Profitableneſs be ſifted by every man if he pleaſe; and after all, if he do not like it, may it be rejected? The Prince is in an ill caſe who hath ſuch Subjects; and he is not in very good whoſe Divines begin but to <pb n="194" facs="tcp:52831:110"/> inſtill ſuch Doctrine into them.</p>
            <p>For (fourthly) grant the Subjects ſuch power, and in a little time no Law ſhall be obſerved, unleſs it be by the duller ſort of People: The ſubtil, the fine, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited will be under no Obligation.

For ſuch is the paſſionate love men bear to their own private Concerns, that they will be very prone to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a thing to be a publick miſchief, which is only a particular burden to their dear ſelves. Let the Parliament, for inſtance, grant his Majeſty a Tax, and it will be poorly paid at this race, and many times not without force: He muſt take it from his Subjects by violence, and be accounted an Oppreſſour, if they judge it not to be for the Common Good. And it will be very hard for thoſe that love money not to be of that judgment. Their Covetouſneſs will ſuggeſt to them, that he ſtands in no need of it, having a great Revenue; or that it is not for a good End; or that the Proportion is too great for thoſe <pb n="195" facs="tcp:52831:110"/> ends that are pretended; and an hundred ſuch like things too long to remember. Nay, what ſhould hinder if he exact it of a poor people, as they may vote themſelves, but that they take Arms alſo for the Publick Good, and the eaſe of the Subjects, as they did in
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time? The Parliament at <hi>Northampton</hi> granted the King a great Subſidy of <hi>Head-money,</hi> at which ſome of the Rabble took great diſtaſte, and ſaid it was an Oppreſſion, and tended to their utter undoing. Preſently the reſt prick'd up their ears at the new truth, and the glorious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which was made of the peoples right to preſerve themſelves. They were aſhamed of their old ignorance, and reſolved to prove good Scholars of thoſe Maſters who taught them not to ſuffer any thing to be done to the Peoples hurt. Their <hi>Lords</hi> and the <hi>Lawyers</hi> they learnt were Tyrants who muſt not be endured: And therefore to their Arms they betook themſelves to root them out. And who could blame them, ſince they were <hi>Judges of their own Actions,</hi> and muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is for the Peoples Weal? Thus they did alſo in after times, when <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh had an aid granted him by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the beginning of his third year, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Relief of the Duke of
<hi>Brittain,</hi> aſſaulted by the <hi>French</hi> King. And although
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52831:111"/> the King did not enter into the War but by the advice of the Three Eſtates, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly contributed to it, yet the
<hi>Northern</hi> men raiſed a Rebellion under colour of the money impoſed, and murthered the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> whom the King had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that Collection: As you may find in our Hiſtorians, and in a
<hi>Dialogue</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Printed at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>

<hi>Corniſh</hi> men took Arms, as the <hi>Northern</hi> men of the

<hi>Scotland</hi> began: They muſt take care of the peoples good, whatſoever became of the Laws. And though the Law conſtrue all Levying of War (as that <hi>Dialogue</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 36) without the Kings Commiſſion, and all Forces raiſed to be intended for the death and deſtruction of the King, not attending the ſequel; and it is judged ſo upon reaſon (ſaith he) for every unlawful and ill action is ſuppoſed to be accompanied with an ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Yet the Publick Security was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and upon this ſcore a new Government by <hi>Tables</hi> (as they called them) erected ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt the Kings Commandment, a <hi>Covenant</hi> entred into, and a <hi>ſeditious Band</hi>

By all which you ſee plainly that this Principle leads to down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Rebellion, if the Subjects think good to follow it; they being Judges as well of that which they are to do, as of that which they are not to do. But let us, if you pleaſe, content our ſelves with ſome leſſer inſtances of its miſchievous conſequence. A Prieſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church thinks, notwithſtanding the Laws which prohibit him, that it is for the Peoples Weal for him to come hither and draw the Kings Subjects to a dependence on the Pope. Doth he ſin in this, or doth he not? If he do, then this Principle is naught: For he is Judge of his own Actions as well as you. Why ſhould he not? Since <hi>every man is made by God the Judge of them.</hi> From whence he may conclude, with this
<hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> that he is not tied to obey any Law which he thinks is not for the Peoples good. The very ſame Pretenſe the People will have, ſhould they moleſt or drive away thoſe ſtrangers that live among them, though the Law ſhould not only permit, but invite them to tranſplant themſelves hither, becauſe they eat the bread out of the Natives mouths. And this was the very caſe in 9th year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 1517. when there was a great heart-burning againſt <pb n="198" facs="tcp:52831:112"/> 
               <hi>Aliens</hi> in the City, eſpecially among the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, who were much grieved that ſo many ſtrangers were permitted to reſort hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And one <hi>John Lincoln,</hi> a Broker, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied himſelf ſo far in the matter (which afterward brought him to the Gallows) that about <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> he came to Dr. <hi>Standiſh,</hi> who was to preach at the <hi>Spittle</hi> on
<hi>Monday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Week, and deſired him he would declare the <hi>great miſchief</hi> that was like to come to the Realm by the liberty which Strangers enjoyed: and he offered him a Bill to read, which he refuſed.

When he had read it, he began his Sermon with this Sentence, <hi>The Heaven is the Lords, but the Earth he hath given to the Children of men.</hi> From whence he ſhewed by as plain conſequence as this in our Caſuiſt, that this Land is given to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men,</hi> and therefore as Birds defend their Neſts, ſo ought <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to cheriſh and maintain themſelves in their Land, and to grieve and hurt Aliens, <hi>for reſpect of their Common-wealth.</hi> I will not trouble you with the reſt of the Story<note n="q" place="margin">Which you may find in the <hi>Survey of Lond<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

And it will be no hard matter to improve their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their own good, and their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it ſo far, as to make them digeſt this new truth: mentioned by his late Majeſty in his Large Declaration<note n="r" place="margin">Pa. 407. out of the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 22. <hi>Sept.</hi>
1638</note> That <hi>what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do of their own heads is much better than what they do in obedience to Authority; the one ſavouring of conſtraint, but the other being voluntary and chearful obedience.</hi> Why not? Since at the ſame time they may be taught that <hi>all power is originally in them, and came from them:</hi> who intruſted particular perſons with it. Which is the ſureſt proof (they will eaſily believe) that it is to be imployed for their good (for they would not have intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it with any body to other purpoſes) and conſequently they muſt retain the power ſtill to hinder thoſe perſons from doing otherwiſe; and in order to that muſt judge whether they do ſo or no. This indeed is for the People to command the Magiſtrate, not to obey him: But it is that Authority which they may fairly aſſume to themſelves from this mans dangerous Maxime. For if People
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52831:113"/> are to ſubmit in all things that are for their good, and no further; then they appeal back to themſelves. And this appeal, they may well think, ſuppoſes power originally in themſelves; ſome of which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as ſupreme and above all Laws; and why they ſhould not take all back when they judge it is not imployed for their good, who can tell? For they are to obey no Laws but thoſe which are for their good, unleſs it be for <hi>fear of wrath;</hi> and when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine together they need not fear that, but can make themſelves dreadful, and give what Laws they pleaſe to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>

It is reſolved juſt before, that if the Magiſtrate command any thing for the Peoples hurt, there lies <hi>no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon Conſcience</hi> to be obedient, and they are made judges of what is for their hurt.

<hi>they muſt avoid contempt and ſcandal.</hi> And ſo they will in their own opinion, even when they are contemptuous and ſcandalous.

In ſhort, this Principle, if it be purſued, will prove the very ſame with that (in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe meaning of it) ſo much cryed up when all our miſchiefs began, <hi>The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the people is the Supreme Law:</hi> for the right underſtanding of which Maxime, I refer you to the <hi>laſt Lecture</hi> of Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> about the Obligation of Conſcience. Who hath uprightly determined elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pralect.</hi> 9.

The Reaſon is, becauſe every man ought to minde what <pb n="202" facs="tcp:52831:114"/> belongs to his part and duty, and not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf about other mens: and our duty is to obey, not to command and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. Beſides, I may add, though the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ought not to ordain any thing but what is for the peoples good, yet when he doth otherwiſe, it will be more for their good to obey him, then to refuſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They ought ſtill to look upon him as <hi>Gods Miniſter for their good,</hi> becauſe they receive a great many benefits by Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Order, be it what it will) though in that particular he do amiſs; and ſo to ſubmit to his command. For the miſchief of not obeying, is greater then the hurt that is done the people by obedience. It is in effect to turn all things upſide down; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the King to the condition of a private man, by making every body a Judge of his Laws whether they ſhall be obeyed or no.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Well; perhaps you will ſay we are all had enough; but when the Doctor now named (Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi>) determines that we ſhould be obedient, though the thing required of us be
<hi>ſomething</hi> hurtful to the Publick, doth he not imply that, if it be
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely</hi> hurtful, we are not obliged? To this I will anſwer before I end; when I have firſt told you, that it doth not follow from what hath been ſaid concerning an obligation upon Conſcience to yeild obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Laws, that <hi>every tranſgreſſion</hi> of a Law is of ſo deep a dye as ſome is. He asks my opinion, you know, about this, in the beginning of his Caſe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think good briefly to direct him to a better
<hi>medium</hi> then any that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to finde out the ſeveral degrees of <pb n="204" facs="tcp:52831:115"/> ſin againſt Humane Laws; and what Laws are of ſuch moment, that a man cannot be accounted a good Chriſtian, or a good Subject that <hi>lives</hi> in <hi>defiance</hi> of them. For this end, look back to what was ſaid concerning the nature of a Law, which will lead you to a right underſtanding in this matter. It is a Declaration of the will of a Prince concerning thoſe things which he judges needful to be done, or avoided by his Subjects. The more needful then he judges any thing to be done or avoided, for the Publick good and ſafety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the more it appears his will is ſet upon it; the more his Law is to be reverenced, and the greater the offence is, if it be broken, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially openly, and with an high hand. Now you may know this, partly by the <hi>matter it ſelf,</hi> as all wiſe men have determined; if it be a matter of Juſtice, Charity, Piety, Religion or Peace. Partly, by the <hi>manner and form</hi> of commanding and forbidding; partly by the <hi>greatneſs of the penalty</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in caſe of diſobedience, and (laſtly) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much by the <hi>Preface</hi> to his Law: in which, if he be pleaſed to expound the <hi>reaſons</hi> and the
<hi>neceſſity</hi> of it, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be great and weighty, his
<hi>minde</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is thereby, without all doubt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that a more then ordinary regard <pb n="205" facs="tcp:52831:115"/> be had to that Law of his. Apply now all this, if you pleaſe, to the Law which hath moved this diſpute, and you will finde that I had reaſon to ſay what I did, and that they have no reaſon to equal the breach of other Laws (which they mention) with the breach of that. An Act of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of our preſent Soveraign made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> required ſuch perſons as had not, and ſhould not perform ſome things therein named, not to come within five Miles of any Corporation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The breach of which Law I hold to be a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſin; and when a man <hi>lives</hi> in it, and in <hi>defiance</hi> of it keeps Conventicles, I ſaid his piety and honeſty might juſtly be called in queſtion. My Reaſon is, becauſe it is plain to me by thoſe indications now named, that the Law-giver judges it to be a matter of great conſequence, and that he is much concerned it ſhould be obſerved. For
<hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>Preface</hi> to it is ſolemn, and lets us know that both <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Civil Peace</hi> and tranquillity depends upon it; and that they are removed from Corporations, becauſe if they were there, they might take an opportunity the better <hi>to diſtil the Poyſonous Principles of Schiſm and Rebellion into the hearts of his Majeſties Subjects, to the great danger of the Church and Kingdom.</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:52831:116"/> This is the reaſon and ground of the Act, which is as great as well can be; and therefore the penalty is great; <hi>forty pound</hi> for every offence: and (as I remember) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment for ſix months, without Bail or Mainprize (if two Juſtices of Peace pleaſe) unleſs upon or before ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment they ſhall ſwear and ſubſcribe the
<hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> mentioned in the Act. Compare now this with the other about <hi>burying in Linnen,</hi> and <hi>about Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> which they make ſuch a talk of, and you will finde neither the <hi>Penalties (five pound</hi> in one Act, and <hi>forty ſhillings</hi> in the other) nor the Reaſons given in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces</hi> any thing near ſo conſiderable as thoſe now mentioned. Which is a ſigne that the Law-giver doth not judge them of equal moment and neceſſity; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the tranſgreſſion of theſe Laws is not ſo heinous, nor ſo much againſt his will, as the tranſgreſſion of the other. The Penalties alſo for offences againſt theſe are ordered to be ſo imployed, that they may do as much good to the Publick, as the offences do hurt, ſetting aſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Authority, which I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> But may not a Law-giver, you will ſay,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52831:116"/> be miſtaken in his judgement, as ſome think there was an error in that which was enacted about <hi>Waggons?</hi> And if he be, why ſhould we obſerve ſuch a Law? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I am not bound abſolutely to be of the Law-giver's <hi>opinion,</hi> that all ſuch things are for the Publick good which he decrees: I am onely to follow his
<hi>will,</hi> and do what he enjoyns when I can without ſin. And this I take my ſelf bound to, even when I conceive it were better for the Publick, if it were otherwiſe ordained. What? will you ſay again, when there is an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inconvenience, and a very grievous evil to the ſubjects by obeying? That's the thing I know you would be reſolved in. And truely the Moral <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> ſay no. It is to be ſuppoſed, when that caſe happens, that it not being the intention of a Prince to make his Subjects miſerable, he would not have made that Law, if he could have foreſeen ſuch a miſchief. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ceaſes of it ſelf to be a Law, and looſes its Obligation. But then in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this to practice, they tell you there are theſe <hi>cautions</hi> to be obſerved. Firſt, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is never to be denyed, but when the Law is againſt the <hi>Publick good.</hi> If it be ſtill conſiſtent with the Publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, though it be to the damage of ſome <pb n="208" facs="tcp:52831:117"/> particular perſons, they may not break the Law. Again, it muſt be practiſed then onely when the Miſchief to the Publick is not ſmall, but ſo great, that in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt and moſt prudent perſons, it be a ſufficient cauſe of diſannulling a Law: and doth out-weigh the evil of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial diſobedience. And (thirdly) this miſchief likewiſe muſt be certain and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, not onely in our fancy. The ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which is, when it is declared ſo by the voice of all men (at leaſt of all the wiſe and good) and not onely by a party, whoſe particular intereſt is concerned to vote it to be unſupportable. And yet in caſe the truely wiſe and good on all ſides think it ſo, they ought not (fourthly) to diſobey the Law with the ſcandal and offence of other men. It muſt be done ſo modeſtly, humbly, and with fear, that the reſt of Mankind be not taught hereby to ſlight all Laws upon little pretences, and trifling regards. And (laſtly) to ſecure all, we muſt, if we have time and opportunity, ask leave of the Law-giver, whoſe leave is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in ſuch caſes, onely in time of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den danger. And having done thus; if we ſhould be miſtaken, and judge that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick miſchief which is not, yet the guilt of our diſobedience will not be deadly, but <pb n="209" facs="tcp:52831:117"/> ſuch as will eaſily finde pardon both with God and man. To this purpoſe you may read more in that Doctor (Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>) out of whom this Caſuiſt quotes a line or two, relating to this matter onely, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all the reſt of his diſcourſe.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> It would be too tedious to add the words of other good men, and therefore I ſhall onely deſire you to ponder the counſel and direction of the famous <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus,</hi> late Profeſſor at <hi>Saumur.</hi> For you are much concerned in it, being given with a particular reſpect to our affairs, in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to our preſent Soveraign<note n="z" place="margin">Paraphr. in <hi>Pſalm</hi> Epiſt. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic.
1662. <hi>pag.</hi> 1.</note>.
<q>There are three things, ſaith he, by which the courſe of our life is governed, and, as we may ſay, ſteered in this Sea of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs. By the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> by the <hi>Laws of our Country;</hi> and by the <hi>Study of propagating Religion.</hi> To this laſt we ſhould yeild all, if the other two do not openly gain-ſay it. Where either the Law of Nature, or the Political Laws do command any thing, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with our Study of promoting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; we muſt diligently conſider, what God commands us in that matter, that <hi>ſo we may exactly diſtinguiſh between his Will and our own; between what he requires, and what we are moved unto onely by our own zeal.</hi> What God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52831:119"/> is to be done, though our Parents or Magiſtrates command the contrary. But whatſoever is commanded by them, which is not contrary to the <hi>expreſs Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Religion</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Diſertis Religionis praceptis non adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note>, that we are to look upon as commanded and given us in charge by God himſelf (becauſe God is the Author of their Power, as he is the Author of Nature) whoſe Commands, and not our own voluntary Zeal, we are to make the Rule of our life. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not here to have more regard, either to the danger which we may fancy the Church is in,</hi>

                  <hi>or to the hope which we have conceived to our ſelves of advancing the Glory of God, then to that Will of the moſt high God, which is manifeſted to us either in Nature, or in Civil Laws.</hi> For God hath affection enough to his own Glory, and kindneſs enough to his Church, and Power and Wiſdom ſufficient, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the dangers that I ſee, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Kingdom, and ſupport his Church: although I contain my ſelf within the bounds and limits which <hi>Nature and Civil Government</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the reſolution of that excellent perſon, by whoſe Principles I wiſh heartily <pb n="213" facs="tcp:52831:119"/> you would all govern your ſelves: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the moſt glorious profeſſion that you can make, will not perſwade us you have the ſame ſpirit of Chriſtian Piety. You have read perhaps, or heard how the <hi>Devil</hi> one day appeared to St.
<hi>Martin,</hi> as he was at prayer; all glittering and ſhining in a moſt Majeſtick ſtate: telling him that he was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who being ſhortly to come down upon Earth, gave him a viſit firſt. This he repeated again, ſaith the ſtory,<note place="margin">Sulpitius Severus in vita ejus,
<hi>cap. 25.</hi>
               </note> and bid him not be faithleſs, but believe. <hi>So I will,</hi> replyed the good man, <hi>but not till I ſee him in that habit and form wherein he ſuffered, bearing the Marks of his Croſs.</hi> The Application is eaſie; and in ſhort but this. If you would be acknowledged for the faithful Diſciple of the Lord Jeſus, let us ſee you in that garb wherein they alway ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; taking up the Croſs patiently, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and lowly, meek and gentle, quiet and peaceable; ſubmiſſive to Government, and obedient to Laws: Till then, we ſuſpend our belief. Farewel.</p>
